This course covers all necessary topics for setting up and administering a Liferay DXP installation. For users who are using LXC-SM, Liferay's PaaS for DXP, you will want to start with the Cloud Administrator course!

```{note}
Go to market even faster by using Liferay Experience Cloud! LXC is a full SaSS offering that saves you time and money by having all of your Liferay infrastructure managed and administered for you so you can focus on delivering business solutions.
```

We recommend that all prospective Liferay administrators, regardless of your deployment paradigm (SaSS, PaaS, or on-prem), go through the Configuration and Users/Accounts/Organizations course to have a baseline understanding of how these concepts work.
