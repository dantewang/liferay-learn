This course covers all necessary topics for setting up and administering a Liferay DXP installation. For those using LXC-SM, Liferay's PaaS for DXP, start with the Cloud Administrator course!

```{note}
Go to market even faster by using Liferay Experience Cloud! LXC is a full SaaS offering that saves you time and money by managing and administering all your Liferay infrastructure for you so you can focus on delivering business solutions.
```

We recommend that all prospective Liferay administrators, regardless of your deployment paradigm (SaaS, PaaS, or on-prem), go through the Configuration and Users/Accounts/Organizations course to have a baseline understanding of how these concepts work.
