# Using Master Pages

Reference documentation: https://learn.liferay.com/en/w/dxp/site-building/creating-pages/defining-headers-and-footers/master-page-templates

NOTE: Do we call these master pages, master page templates?

The header and footer of your pages are important. With master page templates, you'll create a content page that defines these elements, and more. In the Delectable Bonsai site,

1. Open the Product Menu (![Product Menu](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and go to *Design* &rarr; *Page Templates*.

1. Under the Masters tab, click *Add* (![Add](./../../images/icon-add.png)).

1. Enter _Delectable Bonsai MPT_ as the name.

1. In Fragments and Widgets (![Fragments and Widgets](./../../images/icon-add-widget.png)) on the sidebar, add Fragments for the common elements that you require.
NOTE: Need to define what's actually in our MPT.

NOTE: Define the Dialect Theme here? Probably define the theme here so we can then style the pages later in the styling section, where we'll add the CXs as well (theme JS and CSS)
NOTE: "Design Assets", including master pages, will become less tied to the site in the near future. They'll be available as more global resources, scoped in the same way as Asset Libraries. See https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/LPS-155674 and https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CL9RTSZ52/p1687287371241059, and consider how this might change best practices
NOTE: Which pages will be based on this template? All of them?
