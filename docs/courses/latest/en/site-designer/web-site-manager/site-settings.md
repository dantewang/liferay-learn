# Site Settings

To get started managing Delectable Bonsai's public website, you'll first need to establish some basic settings. Site settings encompass everything from the site's name and logo, to enabling specific Liferay functionality. Help Delectable Bonsai's administrators configure all of these settings to set the foundation for adding in pages and content.

Some settings are safe to enable for most kinds of sites, such as enabling an accessibility menu for users. Other settings, such as the site's membership type, must be configured differently for different types of sites. Delectable Bonsai's private intranet, for example, will require the private membership setting when you add it in a later module.

This module walks through configure the site settings for the public Delectable Bonsai site, which users will access as regular customers. In these exercises, you'll change settings for:

* The site's name and logo
* The site's URL
* The site's description
* The site's email domain
* The accessibility menu

This site will replace the Liferay home site that exists out-of-the-box, so some of the basic settings must be changed in your *instance settings*. The first step is to change those instance settings to repurpose the site for Delectable Bonsai.
