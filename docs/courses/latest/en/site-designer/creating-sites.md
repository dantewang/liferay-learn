# Creating Sites

Placeholder content, copied from course outline:


Lessons: 

Creating Site Templates
Template the internal sites (e.g., the b2b and intranet sites)

Creating Public and Private Sites
Create the internal site:
Intranet site

Create the public sites:
   B2B site
   B2C site

Creating Master Page Templates
Define the header and footer of the public site pages (master page templates)
With MPTs, you define a header, footer, and configure the fragments allowed in the drop zone. Regular page templates help manage common layouts and content--they are compatible to use together.
Page design versus content editing. In the drop zone, show how to use the Configure allowed fragments option?

Working with Page Templates: maybe not as common anymore, replaced by DPTs. Master Pages too. Reusing data and templates.

Adding Pages
This basic page list is overridden by James' more robust site plan:
   According to our site sketch for Delectable Bonsai, we need Home, Contact Us, About, ~Products~ (added in Commerce cert), Events, FAQ, Recipes, Blog, Careers
Explain the automatic navigation menu. Note that if you need to customize the nav menu, you can.
Reference DPTs for the product details pages (next module)
In content Pages, weâ€™re going to want to reference developing fragments for the page as needed

Navigation Menus: create another navigation menu. Linking to DPTs is one benefit, external URLs, etc. Look and feel customization as well (ADTs)

Managing Site Membership
Import the Delectable Bonsai users needed to create content. This will likely be done at the very beginning of the course. If possible the setup script will do everything possible from the Liferay Administrator course, including setting up our two virtual instances.
Consider talking about (and cross-linking if appropriate) roles and permissions at the site scope
Teams/User Groups?


Desktop versus Mobile Design/Viewport hierarchy: demonstrate show/hide a fragment depending on viewport
This is a bigger topic, not appropriate for one step in the lesson on MPTs
