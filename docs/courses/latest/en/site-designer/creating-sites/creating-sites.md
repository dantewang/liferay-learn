# Creating Sites

NOTE: Here I'll assume the site requirements and instances are explained in an intro or prior article.

The intranet for Delectable Bonsai is the only site planned for its instance, `breakfast.delectablebonsai.com`.

Create the intranet site as the instance administrator, Kyle Klein:

1. Go to the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; Control Panel &rarr; Sites.

1. Click the Add button (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)) and go to the Custom Site Templates tab.

1. Choose the blank site template and enter the name _Intranet Site_. NOTE: Name it something (James was thinking of Grow)

1. Click _Add_.

   You're brought to the Site Settings for the new site. 

Now the site list for the main instance looks like this:

SCREENSHOT
NOTE: This would have the default site and our new site. But do we get rid of the default site? What's the best practice here? Maybe in a one-site instance the best practice is just to reconfigure the default site.
