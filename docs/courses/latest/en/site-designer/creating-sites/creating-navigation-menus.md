# Creating Navigation Menus

Notes from outline/meeting w/Evan and Mateo: "Linking to DPTs is one benefit, external URLs, etc. Look and feel customization as well (ADTs)"

When you add blank pages to a blank site in Liferay, a navigation menu is provided by default: the page hierarchy of your site's pages are added to this default navigation menu.

NOTE: The reader can't see this in their site, it's really a made-up screenshot to show something--is that okay or must all screenshots show the current state of the site?

From Managing Site Navigation:
See [Using the Navigation Menu Application] to learn how to create Navigation Menus and deploy them on a Page. See [Configuring Menu Displays] to learn more about how to configure the [Menu Display Fragment]  (available in Liferay DXP 7.4+) and [Menu Display Widget].

Add a navigation menu to link to some common resources in both the B2B and B2C sites:

NOTE: Provide steps for adding a Common Resources navigation menu, linking to the wikipedia Bonsai entry and a Web Content article's DPT.  Should we demonstrate the dynamic vocabulary element?

We want to create a different style then the ones available, so style the navigation menu with a widget template.
NOTE: Separate lesson? Is this the right module for it? We can put it off until later. "The navigation menu you created earlier is ugly, so style it..."
