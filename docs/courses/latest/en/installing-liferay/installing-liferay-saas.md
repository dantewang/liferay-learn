# Installing Liferay SaaS

In Liferay SaaS, your Liferay representative manages the infrastructure and Liferay DXP application, so you can focus on what matters to your business. Your work is primarily with Liferay's out-of-the-box features, and managing your own [client extensions](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions).

When your project is provisioned, you'll receive:
- an email from **liferay.cloud** inviting you to set a password for your new administrator account on your Liferay DXP instance.
- an email invitation to the extension environments. Click on *Accept Invite* and you'll be redirected to the [Liferay Cloud console](https://console.liferay.cloud/).
    You must log in to accept the invitation. If you donâ€™t yet have an account, click *Sign up* and fill out the form.

Since Liferay handles your infrastructure and Liferay DXP application, you only have access to the extension environments. Extensions environments are provided for deploying custom services (client extensions) that integrate with the Experience Builder PRD and UAT instance respectively, or with other public or private service APIs.
