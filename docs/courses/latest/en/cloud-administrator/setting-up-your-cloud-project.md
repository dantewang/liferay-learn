# Setting Up Your Cloud Project

Your first task after you have an environment provisioned for you on Liferay Cloud, either on Liferay Experience Cloud (LXC) or LXC Self-Managed, is to access the cloud console.

In Liferay Experience Cloud, you use the cloud console to manage each of your environment's services, including the [web server](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/platform-services/web-server-service) and [database](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/platform-services/database-service/database-service). In LXC-SM, these services are managed for you, but you still use the console to manage your own [client extensions](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions).

Here you'll help Delectable Bonsai's IT staff, Marcus and Kyle, to access the cloud console and acquire [the tools that you'll need](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool) to deploy changes to your Cloud environment.
