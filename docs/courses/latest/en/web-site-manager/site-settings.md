# Site Settings

To get started managing Delectable Bonsai's public website, you'll first need to establish some basic settings. Site settings encompass everything from the site's name and logo, to its URL and membership policy. Help Delectable Bonsai's administrators configure all of these settings to set the foundation for adding in pages and content.

Some settings are safe to enable for most kinds of sites, such as enabling an accessibility menu for users. Other settings, such as the site's membership type, must be configured differently for different types of sites. Delectable Bonsai's private intranet, for example, requires the private membership setting when you add it in a later module.

This module walks through configuring the site settings for the public Delectable Bonsai site, for customers to access. In these exercises, you'll change settings for

* The site's name and logo
* The site's URL
* The site's description
* The site's email domain
* The accessibility menu

This site will replace the Liferay home site that exists out-of-the-box, so some of the basic settings must be changed in your *instance settings*. The first step is to change those instance settings to repurpose the site for Delectable Bonsai.

<!-- I think it would be good to include here a walkthrough of the interface and terminology, similar to what you saw on Help Center (which was in our old docs in the liferay-docs repo). The vision for these intro articles was to teach concepts before you get into the actual activities, so you could define all the interface terms you throw around later (control menu, site menu, etc) here so they aren't strange when you get to the exercises. -Rich -->
