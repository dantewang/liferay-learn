# Creating Pages

Now that Clarity's public site settings are configured, it's time to add and configure some pages so users can access the site.

Once you're done with the lessons here, Clarity's public site will have this structure:

- Home
- Search
- Shop
- Events
- FAQ
- About Us
   - Careers

The Home and Search pages will be usable and have content, while most of the others will be populated during the Content Management module. The Shop page will be blank until the Commerce Architect course. Begin by repurposing the default Home page of the site.

<!-- Should we import the commerce B2C solution so the Shop Page is good? We probably do need some products if we want some sort of better product slider on the home page, which only makes sense. -->
