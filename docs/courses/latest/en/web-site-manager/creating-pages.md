# Creating Pages

Now that Clarity's public site settings are configured, it's time to add and configure some pages so users can access the site.

Once you're done with the lessons here, Clarity's public site will have this structure:

- Home
- Search
- Shop
- Events
- FAQ
- About Us
   - Careers

The Home and Search pages will be usable and have content, while most of the others will be populated during the Content Management module. The Shop page will be blank until the Commerce Architect course. Begin by repurposing the default Home page of the site.

## Creating Pages
## Defining Common Page Elements/Creating Master Pages
## Navigating the Site/Site Navigation Menus
## Configuring a Search Page
## Designing Pages with Fragments

<!-- You haven't explained what a fragment is or what students will do with it. That needs to go into the intro article. -Rich -->
<!-- Sounds good to me. Students should also understand why that is: because fragments are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and you explained this in the intro. -Rich -->

<!-- Should we import the commerce B2C solution so the Shop Page is good? We probably do need some products if we want some sort of better product slider on the home page, which only makes sense. -->

<!-- Yes, by the end of the course, or maybe by the start of the next one you can import this site as well as the Shop page. --Rich -->

<!-- The intro article for each module is the only place where you get a chance to talk about concepts. I haven't gone through the other files yet, but if there's teaching of concepts in them, I'm going to ask that you move that here. We want to touch lightly on the concepts and give students a map of where they're headed in this module, along with screenshots of the completed task they can compare with what they do. For example, in the Application Developer course, each module starts off explaining the concepts students will use in that module: https://learn.liferay.com/w/courses/application-development/implementing-business-logic

This intro needs to do that. Talk about fragments and resources and what they are. Explain the structure of the home page, that it'll have a header and a footer. Explain that navigation and site structure aren't the same thing in Liferay. Don't repeat the documentation: explain it from the perspective of exactly what the student will be doing for the Clarity site. Use diagrams if they'll help. -Rich -->
