# Site Templates

Time is essential when you are dealing with larger projects. One of the ways to accelerate the process is to use site templates.

Site templates are used for designing structures and content that you can use during site creation. In Liferay, each template includes most standard site applications for adding pages, stylebooks, web content, and more. Sites created with a template inherit all of its data.

Once you create a site using a template, you can make changes to the templateâ€™s pages and automatically propagate those changes to connected sites.

In this module, you are creating a site template with common elements that can be used in other sites (About Us, Contact Us, and Careers pages) and use this template to generate two sites: an intranet for Clarity employees called Glance and a B2B platform.
