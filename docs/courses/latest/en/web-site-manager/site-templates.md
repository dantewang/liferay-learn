# Site Templates

With *Site Templates*, you can create a prototype or boilerplate for not just a page, but for an entire site. Here are some key advantages: 

1. *Time and Effort Savings and Ease of Site Creation*. If you need multiple sites with the same structure and content, you can create a site template with predefined layouts, pages, and content. This saves time and effort during the site creation process as users can create new sites based on these templates with minimal configuration.

1. *Consistency Across Sites and Standardized Content*. Define a consistent look and feel across multiple websites to ensure a uniform brand identity and user experience. You can also keep consistency by standardizing content (e.g., headers, footers, and navigation menus) across multiple sites.

1. *Global Updates*. You can apply changes globally to all sites that use the same template. This simplifies maintenance and ensures the same updates are applied uniformly across all associated sites.

1. *Reusability*. Templates can be reused across different projects or initiatives, promoting scalability.

Each template includes most standard site applications for adding pages, stylebooks, web content, and more. Sites created with a template inherit all of the template's data. And once you create a site using a template, you can change it in two ways: by making changes outside the template to customize that individual site, or by making changes to the template so those changes automatically propagate to connected sites.

<!-- Here, you should talk about what's coming: the steps taken to create the site template, the concepts the student will learn (such as master page templates, compositions, etc.). Add a relevant screenshot showing the site template and its structure of pages. -Rich -->

Here, you'll create a site template with common elements that can be used in other sites (header, footer, menu, and About Us, Contact Us, and Careers pages) and use this template to generate other sites: an intranet for Clarity employees called Glance and a B2B platform.
