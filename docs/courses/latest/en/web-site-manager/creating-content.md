# Creating Content

Creating content is an integral part of running a website:

-   It's needed for marketing purposes, social media campaigns, blog posts, and email newsletters.

-   Content, such as a list of frequently asked questions, describes products, services, and information to online visitors.

-   Internal content such as newsletters, events announcements, and training materials informs employees.

These examples provide a glimpse into the kind of content that could be on a site. Different organizations engage in additional content initiatives tailored to their specific needs and goals.

Fortunately, Liferay provides tools to make the content creation process easier and faster. When you have a lot of content to manage, you can create _web content structures_ to enforce a format for your content, so content content is created consistently and with a uniform format.

Structures are rendered using a _web content template_ associated with the structure, so content is presented exactly the way you want it.

Content creators create _web content articles_ using the structure, and when they're published, they're displayed using the template. These elements help you maintain consistency throughout your content.

In this module, you'll create structures and templates for two types of content: one related to upcoming events and the other comprising lists of frequently asked questions and their answers (FAQs).
