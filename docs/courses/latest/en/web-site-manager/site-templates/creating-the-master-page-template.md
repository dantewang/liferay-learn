# Creating the Master Page Template

Master page templates provide a way to define elements common to every page using fragments, so you can maintain and manage them easily in the portal without having to deploy a plugin.

You can use the same master page template across an entire site or have unique templates for each page.

In this exercise, you are creating a master page template and using it to create the pages for the site template.

## Creating and Editing the Master Page Template

1. Open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and select *Design* &rarr; *Page Templates*.

1. Under the Masters tab, click *Add* (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)). Let's name this page template `Main Page` &rarr; click *Save*.

   You are redirected to the page editor.

1. In the search bar under Fragments and Widgets, search for `Header` (1). The custom header composition you imported shows under Compositions (2). Drag and drop it on top of the Drop Zone (3).

   ![Drag and drop the custom composition to the editing area.](./creating-the-master-page-template/images/01.png)

1. Next, search for the `Footer`. The custom footer composition also shows under Compositions. Drag and drop it under the Drop Zone.

With the the header and the footer in place, let's edit the way they look.

### Editing the Look and Feel of the Custom Header

First, add a background to the header:

1. Select the outer *Container* (1) in the header composition. On the right, select the *Style* tab (2).

   You can also select the outer *Container* by using the Browser menu on the left.

<!-- 1. Under Background, Select *Direct* under Image Source (3). -->
<!-- I am not sure if this step needs to be mentioned. The Direct option is the default once we select the tabs. But I thought, maybe, someone could alter this option by accident. Then, they would not be able to add the image manually (the + icon would not be enabled). - Eric -->

1. Under Background Image, click the `+` icon (3), open the *Assets* folder, and select the `header-background.svg` image.

Then, add the logo to the Image fragment:

1. Click the *Image* fragment twice (this selects the image-square inside the Image fragment). On the right, select the *Image Source* tab.

   You can also select the *image-square* by using the Browser menu on the left (1).

   ![Select the image-square through the Browser menu on the left.](./creating-the-master-page-template/images/04.png)

<!-- 1. Under Source Selection (2), Select *Direct* under Image Source. -->

1. Under Image, click the + icon, open the *Assets* folder and select the `glance-white-logo.svg` image.

Your custom header is ready.

### Editing the Look and Feel of the Custom Footer

First, add a background to the footer:

1. Select the outer *Container* (1) in the footer composition. On the right, select the *Style* tab (2).

   You can also select the outer *Container* by using the Browser menu on the left.

<!-- 1. Under Background, Select *Direct* under Image Source (3). -->

1. Under Background Image, click the + icon, open the *Assets* folder, and select the `footer-background.svg` image.

Second, add the logo to the footer:

1. In the first grid module, click the *Image* fragment twice (this selects the image-square inside the Image fragment). On the right, select the *Image Source* tab.

<!-- 1. Under Source Selection, Select *Direct* under Image Source. -->

1. Under Image, click the `+` icon, open the *Assets* folder and select the `glance-white-logo.svg` image.

   You can also click three times on the Image fragment to open the modal where you select the image.

Third, alter the texts:

1. In the second grid module, select the *Dialect Text* fragment. Double click to edit the text &rarr; change the text to `The Company`.

   Under this fragment, you are adding (later in this module) the primary menu navigation with the pages created for the site template.

1. In the third grid module, select the *Dialect Text* fragment &rarr; Change the text to `Talk to us`.

1. Alter the paragraph's content to:

Your custom footer is ready.
