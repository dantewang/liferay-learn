# Creating the Master Page Template

Master page templates provide a way to define elements common to every page using fragments, so you can maintain and manage them easily in the portal without having to deploy a plugin.

You can use the same master page template across an entire site or have unique templates for each page.

In this exercise, you are creating a master page template and using it to create the pages for the site template.

## Creating and Editing the Master Page Template

1. Open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and select *Design* &rarr; *Page Templates*.

1. Under the Masters tab, click *Add* (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)). Let's name this page template `Main Page`.

1. In the search bar under Fragments and Widgets, search for `header` (1). The custom header composition you imported shows under Compositions (2). Drag and drop it on top of the Drop Zone (3).

   ![Drag and drop the custom composition to the editing area.](./creating-the-master-page-template/images/01.png)

1. Next, search for the `footer`. The custom footer composition also shows under Compositions. Drag and drop it under the Drop Zone.

With the the main page ready, let's edit the way it looks.

### Editing the Look and Feel of the Custom Header

First, add a background to the header:

1. Click on the outer *Container* (1) in the header composition. On the right, select the *Style* tab (2).

   You can also select the outer *Container* by using the Browser menu on the left.

1. Under Background, Select *Direct* under Image Source (3).

1. Under Background Image, click the `+` icon, open the *Assets* folder, and select the `header-background.svg` image.

Then, add the logo to the Image fragment:

1. Click on the *Image* fragment twice (this selects the image-square inside the Image fragment). On the right, select the *Image Source* tab.

   You can also select the *image-square* by using the Browser menu on the left (1).

   ![Select the image-square through the Browser menu on the left.](./creating-the-master-page-template/images/04.png)

1. Under Image, click the + icon, open the *Assets* folder, and select the `glance-white-logo.svg` image.

Your custom header is ready.

   Use the Browser menu to ensure that the Image fragment is located inside the first Module's Container. If it isn't, drag and drop it inside the Container element in the Browser menu.

   You can also click three times on the Image fragment to open the modal where you select the image.

Third, alter the texts:

1. Select the *Dialect Text* fragment in the second module in the footer's grid. Double click on it to edit the text. Change the text to `The Company`.

   Under this fragment, you are adding (later in this module) the primary menu navigation with the pages created for the site template.

1. Select the *Dialect Text* fragment in the third module in the footer's grid. Change the text to `Talk to us`.

1. Add a Paragraph fragment to the same container under the Dialect Text.
