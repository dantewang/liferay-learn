Define workflow, explain the single approver, show a diagram view of it

   Talk about how you can enable workflow at different scopes. Clarity just needs it at the site scope. However, it will apply to all structures, so maybe we don't want this. We could use folders perhaps? Is there a way to restrict a structure to a folder? We'd need that. You can also get the structure ID/key in the workflow and review only if it matches the FAQ key, but that's probably not good since it wouldn't work in LXC. Anyway, we should address it.

Define Publications

Give some information about how they interact

Let's Go!

Clarity's public site is in place, with some content already added. However, there are blogs to be written, events to be created, and FAQs to add in the site. Clarity wants to protect its brand by ensuring only properly reviewed content is published in the site. Its blogs, for example, should be written by experts on the topic (Scientist Sam?), then reviewed by the marketing manager, (Molly Markets?), before publication.

In addition, the design team (is it the design team) wants to preview the site with all the new content before putting it in front of the public. Therefore, all approved content will be added to a _publication_, where it can be vetted by the design team, and then published all at once. Clarity wants to do this weekly.

Is there a way to stage stuff in a publication but let other stuff be approved as it's ready, like blogs? Maybe we'd do that.

Workflow reviewers, if working in a publication, need access not just to the content but also to the publication.

If we're using Blogs here for workflow, when should we configure the Blog page. We create it in Creating Pages but leave it blank.

Configure the Blogs Page
Or we could do this for FAQ? Then we'll show the diff functionality
