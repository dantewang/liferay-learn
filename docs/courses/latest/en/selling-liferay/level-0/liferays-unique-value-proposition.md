## Background

This module explains Liferay’s Unique Value Proposition, as well as the Unique Selling Propositions or USPs that support that value proposition.  

While many other competitors claim to deliver the same value, only Liferay provides the unique combination of characteristics and traits that set us apart and help Liferay provide value to our customers.  

## What is a Value Proposition anyway?

Software vendors often use the term Value Proposition or Value Prop, along with terms like USP or UVP. To avoid confusion it is helpful to understand the definitions for these terms.

A **Value Proposition** is a statement that clearly conveys the product a vendor promises to deliver to their customers.  A value proposition motivates potential customers to choose one vendor over another. It should speak to a customer’s challenge and make the case for your company as the problem-solver.  

To put it even more simply it is the short statement that answers the question, “What do you do?”  

A **Unique Selling Proposition** or USP is something that differentiates products and a brand from competitors and allows a vendor to gain a competitive advantage by positioning offerings and the company in a unique way.  

USPs help to support the Value Proposition and highlight benefits that target audiences perceive as valuable.

While the wording of each vendor’s Value Proposition will be different, many vendors will be proposing the same value. USPs meanwhile are the key differentiators that set one vendor apart from competitors and establish them in the market.

## What is Liferay’s Value Proposition?

As stated on liferay.com, Liferay’s Value Propositions is that Liferay is the Complete Platform for Tailored Solutions. Liferay allows our customers to create custom digital experiences without sacrificing speed, flexibility, or cost.

This statement captures the unique values that Liferay has been providing for years.  From the very beginning Liferay has been more than a portal, it has been a platform that technical users could customize as needed to solve almost any business problem.  

At times, the ability to customize has been both a benefit and a challenge.  It provides complete flexibility, but can create a burden on the teams tasked with maintaining and upgrading the platform.  

Liferay has focused on enabling Liferay Experience Cloud to be used to develop solutions that can be tailored to customers’ unique needs, without modifying the core of the platform.

Or in other words, to customize the digital experience, not the platform.
