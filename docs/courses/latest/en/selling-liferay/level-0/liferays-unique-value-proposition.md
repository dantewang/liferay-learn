## Background

This module explains Liferay’s unique value proposition, as well as the Unique Selling Propositions or USPs that support that value proposition.

While competitors claim to deliver the same value, only Liferay has the unique combination of characteristics and traits that set us apart from those competitors to provide more value to our customers.

## What is a Value Proposition anyway?

Software vendors often use the term Value Proposition or Value Prop, along with terms like USP or UVP. To avoid confusion it is helpful to define these terms.

A **Value Proposition** is a statement that clearly conveys the product a vendor promises to deliver to their customers. A value proposition motivates potential customers to choose one vendor over another. It should speak to a customer’s challenge and make the case for your company as the problem-solver.

More simply, it answers the question, “What do you do?”

A **Unique Selling Proposition** or USP is a differentiating statement that separates products and a brand from competitors and allows a vendor to gain a competitive advantage by positioning offerings and the company in a unique way.

USPs help support the value proposition and highlight benefits that target audiences perceive as valuable.

While the wording of each vendor’s value proposition is different, many vendors propose the same value. USPs, however, are the key differentiators that set vendors apart from their competitors and establish them in the market.

## What is Liferay’s Value Proposition?

As stated on liferay.com, Liferay’s value proposition states that Liferay is the complete platform for tailored solutions. With Liferay, our customers can create custom digital experiences without sacrificing speed, flexibility, or cost.

This statement captures the unique values that Liferay has demonstrated for years. From the beginning Liferay has been more than a portal; it has been a platform that technical users could customize as needed to solve almost any business problem.

At times, this customization ability has been both a benefit and a challenge. It provides complete flexibility, but can create a burden for teams tasked with maintaining and upgrading the platform.

Recently, Liferay has focused on delivering Liferay Experience Cloud for developing solutions tailored to customers’ unique needs, without modifying the core of the platform.

Or in other words, to deliver solutions that customize the digital experience, not the platform. We are well positioned to do that because of our open source portal heritage and our unparalleled ease of customization. Ready to hear more?
