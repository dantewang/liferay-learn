# What is a Digital Experience Platform

Definitions for Digital Experience Platforms vary from one analyst to another, but the broad definition is very similar.  For example most analysts use phrases like

> Digital Experience Platforms “deliver contextualized digital experiences, optimization of customer journey and touchpoints, integrated and cohesive, tailoring experience with context and value with commerce.”

Liferay definition of a DXP is as follows:

> “Enterprise software that provides the foundation for companies to deliver connected, contextualized digital experiences across multiple touchpoints for the entire customer journey.

> Put simply, a DXP is a single platform that has all the elements to deliver external and internal digital experiences.”

## Anatomy of a Digital Experience Platform

The basic anatomy of a Digital Experience Platform could be described as follows:

* First are the Digital Touchpoints where our Customers interact with their users---their customers, employees, citizens, businesses, partners, etc. These are the experiences that an end user has as they interact with the company which might be web, mobile, ChatBot, kiosk, IoT etc.
* These touchpoints then provide some sort of presentation layer---which may be supplied by the platform itself, or implemented via headless API capabilities. Liferay’s presentation layer is flexible enough to support all and any of these types of presentation technologies.
* These interfaces serve information and data sourced from various enterprise data sources or content authoring systems. These disparate data sources include CRM, ERP, HRIS, Marketing Automation tools, and many others.
* The DXP therefore must include some sort of integration layer---which might be native to the platform or some 3rd party tool like an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
* The integration layer makes it possible to connect to the enterprise data sources, and may use technologies and frameworks like OpenAPI, GraphQL, SOAP, JSON etc.

The heart of a DXP, however, sits between the presentation and integration layers. This is the promise of a DXP's transformative power for a customer's business.

That promise is Contextual Delivery: delivering the right content to the right person at the right time in the right context.

Contextual delivery includes things like content management and authoring, web experience, analytics, personalization and segmentation, digital asset management, forms and workflow, digital commerce, no-code/low-code application building capabilities, easily deployed theming, and more.

## Solutions Across the Entire Customer Journey

Another way to look at what a DXP should provide is to look at the customer life cycle.  Typically this starts well before a customer becomes a customer, continues through engaging with the customer, converting them, and then retaining them by serving them well and growing them.
