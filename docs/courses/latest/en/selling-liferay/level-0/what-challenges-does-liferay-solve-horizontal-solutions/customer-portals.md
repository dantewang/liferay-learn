# Customer Portals

A customer portal provides customers with a single point of access to all relevant information about the products and services they have purchased from a vendor.

Key to this is the organization's customers/end users use the solution to access products and services.

## Target Buyers

The primary buying audience for a customer portal is from Customer Success, Sales, Operations or Marketing. IT is also often involved:

* Head of Customer Success/Experience
* Head of Operations
* CFO/VP Finance
* CMO/VP of Marketing
* CIO/Head of IT

## Key Benefits

Each organization has its own unique needs, but these key benefits of a customer portal should resonate with all audiences:

* A customer portal **Streamlines Onboarding** and provides a personalized experience that helps the end customers get the most out the relationship.
* With **Account Management** capabilities, and by **Facilitating Self-Service** Liferay's customers can empower _their_ customers to handle common business tasks such as making routine purchases, making payments, and managing their account information.
* Customer portals can **Help Customers Find Answers** and solve their own problems.
* Customers expect to be able to conduct business on their own terms, and a customer portal supports that by providing **24/7 Secure Availability**.
