# Customer Portals

A customer portal provides customers with a single point of access to all relevant information about the products and services they have purchased from a vendor.

Key to this is the organization's customers/end users use the solution to access products and services.

## Target Audience

The primary buying audience for a customer portal is from Customer Success, Sales, Operations or Marketing. IT may also be involved:

* Head of Customer Success/Experience
* Head of Operations
* CFO/VP Finance
* CMO/VP of Marketing
* CIO/Head of IT

## Key Benefits

Each organization has its own unique needs, but these key benefits of a customer portal should resonate with all audiences:

* A customer portal **Streamlines Onboarding** and provides a personalized experience that help customers get the most out the relationship.
* Customer portals **Empower Customers** with account management capabilities and self service so they can handle common business tasks such as making routine purchases, making payments, and managing their account information.
* Customer portals can **Help Customers Find Answers** and solve their own problems.
