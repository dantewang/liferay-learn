# Partner Portals

A partner portal provides partners with access to deal registration, marketing resources, pricing and sales information for products and services, as well as technical details and support.

## Target Audience

The key stakeholders for a partner portal reflect the structure of the company, but the decision maker is typically high in the sales organization such as the Chief Sales Officer (CSO) or the leader of the sales or channels team. The IT team also contributes to the decision.

* CSO
* Head of, Director of, VP of, Manager
  * Sales
  * Channels
* CIO/Head of IT

## Key Benefits

Partner Portals provide many benefits for both the portal's host and the external partners.

* By providing partners with access to all of the resources they need to effectively sell the organizationâ€™s products, they **help partners grow revenue**.
* Personalized experiences give partners **what they need faster**.
