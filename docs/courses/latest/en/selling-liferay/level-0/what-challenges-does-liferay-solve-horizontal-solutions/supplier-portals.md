# Supplier Portals

A supplier portal allows a company to connect and collaborate with suppliers of goods and services.  Most users of Supplier portals are manufacturers with complex supply chains. Any company in any industry must rely on suppliers to some degree, and as they grow, they benefit from a supplier portal as relationships with suppliers become more difficult to manage. 

## Target Audience

Supplier portal projects are typically led by procurement departments. Due to integration requirements (in particular with ERPs), the leaders of the Finance and IT departments are also heavily involved:

* Head of Procurement
* CFO/VP Finance
* CIO/Head of IT

## Key Benefits

Supplier portals bring benefits to internal and external stakeholders:

* They make organizations **easy to do business with** and attract new suppliers.
* They allow organizations to automate processes and **reduce the cost to onboard** and **manage** suppliers.
* Personalized experiences that save suppliers time help **build strong supplier relationships**.
* Automation and data validation help **improve accuracy of data** and important information.
