# Supplier Portals

A Supplier Portal is a website that allows a company to connect and collaborate with suppliers of goods and services.  Supplier Portals are most commonly associated with manufacturers with complex supply chains. Any company in any industry will rely on suppliers to some degree and as they grow, their relationship with suppliers can become more difficult to manage and they may also benefit from a supplier portal.

## Target Audience

Supplier Portals projects are typically led by procurement departments. Due to integration requirements (in particular with ERPs) the leaders of the Finance and IT departments are also heavily involved:

* Head of Procurement
* CFO/VP Finance
* CIO/Head of IT

## Key Benefits

Supplier portals bring benefits to internal and external stakeholders:

* They make organizations **easy to do business with** and attract new suppliers
* They allow organizations to automate processes and **reduce the cost to onboard** and **manage** suppliers
* Personalized experiences that save suppliers time help to **build strong supplier relationships**
* Automation and data validation help **improve accuracy of data** and important information
