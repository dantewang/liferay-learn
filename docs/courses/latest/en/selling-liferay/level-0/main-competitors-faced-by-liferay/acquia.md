# Acquia

**At a Glance**

* Acquia’s strengths lie in B2C use cases and pure play CMS
* Acquia is late to market with headless capabilities
* Current corporate focus is on going to IPO - not on their customers.
* For use cases requiring authenticated, logged-in experiences Liferay is a better choice.

## Acquia Drupal Cloud

Drupal (a CMS) is the foundation of Acquia’s Digital Experience Platform. Acquia’s strengths lie in B2C use cases and pure play CMS - so it is mainly in this specific situation where they stand as a competitor for Liferay.

Acquia competes in a variety of industries but not heavily in Europe.

In Europe we meet Drupal in almost every “pure CMS” opportunity where the customer is looking for a public website, but where there is a true DXP need, Drupal is not present.

Since Acquia (and Drupal) is focused on B2C and CMS use cases, they are weaker when it comes to authenticated experiences requiring granular access management and roles and permissions capabilities.

Among Acquia’s many acquisitions include:

* Widen Enterprises, Inc
* AgilOne
* Cohesion

Acquia is currently owned by Vista Equity Partners, which adds uncertainty to the vendor’s commitment to long-term customer value.

Vista Equity Partners’ primary goal for Acquia right now is to take them to IPO. While that’s great for investors, it’s not necessarily good for customers.

Among common concerns for customers is that partner knowledge and Acquia consulting services seem mixed. In some cases, Acquia consulting services has had to come in and save the day. In others, it was the partner who had to save Acquia consulting services from a situation.

High cost is another issue - pricing and contracts are considered confusing and hard to navigate. Sources say pricing is a battle with cloud-only offerings, support services, and what tools were added and needed to provide the solution the customer required.

Many so-called partners would sell “Drupal” hosted on a 3rd party cloud hosting company like Rackspace and add their own managed services instead of selling Acquia, which is confusing for the end customer and not a great partner model either.

Although Drupal (the open source version, not Acquia) is touted as “free of charge” and a fully customizable platform, that isn’t entirely true. Drupal is a free and open-source web content management framework, but the actual implementation costs of Drupal can be very expensive. This is particularly true for organizations with large-scale websites, including native mobile apps. Drupal was designed as a “developer’s tool” - it simply was not designed to be intuitive for the non-technical user. Consequently, most organizations require a team of full-stack developers, or else their website will not be customized.

Acquia also seems to have been somewhat late in introducing headless capabilities. The first release of their Headless Starter Kit only came in the last quarter of last  year (Q4 2022), so it is fair to assume that the capabilities might be relatively unsophisticated.

## Why Liferay Wins

* Liferay excels at authenticated use cases, such as B2E and B2B customer portals’ use cases. So whenever there are complex and authenticated self-service elements included, Liferay chances of winning become greater.
* Liferay is fortunate to have been consistently profitable since our founding in 2004. We have never taken any outside investment and remain privately owned by our founders. Decisions on Liferay product, strategy, and direction are not governed by investors wanting to make a lot of money, or by directors needing to fulfill shareholder and stock value ambitions. This allows Liferay to focus on long-term customer value.
