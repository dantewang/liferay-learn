# Adobe

**At a Glance**

* Adobe’s strengths lie in marketing scenarios
* Multiple products are required for successful implementation which leads to high costs
* Organizations need massive and highly qualified internal resources
* Liferay offers a much lower TCO for complex scenarios and integrations

## Adobe Experience Cloud

Adobe Experience Cloud, formerly Adobe Marketing Cloud, is a collection of content management, commerce, online marketing and web analytics products that were acquired by Adobe over several years and then rebranded to "Adobe - something" and stitched together.

Liferay competes with Adobe in most industries:

* Retail
* Financial Services
* Healthcare
* High Tech
* Manufacturing
* Travel
* Telecommunications
* And more.

Adobe is less often seen in the public sector because of their high cost compared to other platforms.

When the prospect is a large enterprise, when they want to _identify_ themselves as a large enterprise, and when they have a lot of money Adobe will always be present.

Adobe is primarily a marketing-focused company that has built its platform by acquiring several other businesses over a number of years, including:

* Allegorithmic
* Marketo
* Magento
* Uru (AI startup)

Adobe’s DXP is therefore composed of acquired products bolted together, leading to a situation where the parts of the platform do not necessarily work together seamlessly, or even where the customer might need to develop custom integration within the suite to reach the results required.

As the products within the suite were not designed to work together, the user experience and the developer experience in different parts of the platform can be inconsistent and fragmented. This means training users will be harder and slower.

Adobe’s DXP might look great, but customers cite weak integrations within their suite and also app development capabilities as pain points. Pain with app development is probably caused by the fragmented developer experiences across the stack.

Adobe leverages industry reports, such as Gartner, that place Adobe’s Experience Cloud as a market leading DXP. This approach has led to the customer sentiment that “you can’t go wrong with Adobe”.

Adobe sales reps take “a flexible” sales approach and focus on selling only one or two DXP products. Then the sales reps sell other modules only after the relationship is established. But because multiple Adobe products are required for a successful implementation, costs can become astronomically higher than what the customer initially budgeted for, or purchased.

## Why Liferay Wins

* Adobe Experience Cloud deployment costs are high when compared to Liferay - and often _very_ high.
* Organizations considering buying Adobe should carefully consider whether their needs map back to Adobe’s capabilities and whether they have a clear plan and adequate internal resources.
* Adobe customers need to have a really large team of experienced people in order to develop and maintain the platform and experience the full benefits of its capabilities. Often this is not viable, practically or economically, and customers find themselves unable to use the platform they’ve purchased, and where actual needs could have been met a much more cost effective platform like Liferay.
* Buying the wrong platform means that customers are overpaying even if they received a big discount.
* Liferay outperforms Adobe, and provides a substantially lower TCO for complex scenarios requiring extensive integration with other systems, including legacy, internal and back-office systems.
* Liferay DXP offers OOTB product capabilities for scenarios beyond marketing for example: Intranets, Partner Portals, etc. that are designed to work together seamlessly.
