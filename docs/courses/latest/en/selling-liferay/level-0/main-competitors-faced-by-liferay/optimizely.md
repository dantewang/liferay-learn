# Optimizely

**At a Glance**

* Optimizely strengths lie in B2C use cases.
* There are limitations with security and access controls.
* The platform includes multiple acquired technologies that lack a unified UI.
* Liferay is strong with authenticated user experiences.

## Optimizely

Optimizely, formerly Episerver, also has strengths which lie primarily in B2C use cases, and the platform provides a complete picture into customer buying behavior.

Optimizely is typically a competitor in the following industries:

* Media
* Travel
* Retail
* High Tech
* And also in other industries.

Like both Adobe and Sitecore, Optimizely has also acquired several companies, and was itself acquired by Episerver in 2021. Acquisitions include:

* Insite (B2B Commerce)
* Welcome
* Zaius

Among some of the most common complaints from customers is that Optimizely’s employee experience capabilities are lacking.

Rationalization and integration of multiple technologies acquired by Optimizely are still lacking a unified UI, while cross-product functionality between acquired and organic products remains basic at best.

Optimizely’s lack of unified analytics reporting across the various parts of their platform makes discovery of actionable insights disjointed.

There are some reported limitations with security and access controls. With prospects and solution needs where these are critical factors, for example Employee Portals, Healthcare Portals, Internet Banking, Citizen Self-Service Portals and so on - Liferay has a great chance of winning over Optimizely.

## Why Liferay Wins

* Liferay is stronger than Optimizely at core portal services. Liferay's long heritage as a leading portal platform means it is the most efficient platform for building and maintaining portals without the need for custom development. By leveraging Liferay's Low Code/No Code tools and extensive Open API platform, users have the ability to quickly expose functionality across their IT ecosystem, including legacy systems of record, microservices (remote apps), and Liferay Objects.
* Collaboration between individuals, teams and organizations is a key component of most portal projects. Liferay is homogenous and organically grown. The nature of the Liferay technology stack contributes not only to better user experiences and feature compatibility, but it also leads to overall lower TCO due to less demands on the customer’s IT support staff.
