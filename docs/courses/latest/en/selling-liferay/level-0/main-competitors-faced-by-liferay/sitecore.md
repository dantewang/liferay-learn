# Sitecore

**At a Glance**

* Sitecore’s strengths lie in support for personalization and campaigns.
* Proper integrations are lacking for acquired technology.
* Customers and Partners report Sitecore’s lack of direct support.
* Liferay was natively built to work together to handle Enterprise complexity and integrations.

## Sitecore

As with Adobe, Sitecore typically competes across a variety of industries.

Sitecore claims they are the number one platform in the world, and the only vendor combining content, commerce and data.

That is _not_ true - most DXPs, including Liferay, provide those capabilities. Moreover, many customers argue that Sitecore does not do it very well.

Sitecore appeals primarily to Marketing leaders because of its strength in support for personalization and campaigns. However, much like Adobe, Sitecore’s DXP is comprised of several acquisitions, including:

* Reflekton
* Moosend
* Boxever

Taking several technologies, loosely stitching them together, and rebranding them as a single platform doesn’t mean that they actually work well together or produce a coherent user or developer experience.

Sitecore customers report issues with high pricing in comparison to similar platforms, and even Gartner has reported that some customers accumulate continuous technical debt from each version upgrade; requiring more investment in professional services or engaging a partner.

There are also doubts about the consistency of Sitecore’s partners. Customers indicate that there are weak partners and that it is not necessarily easy to determine whether a partner is strong or weak.

## Why Liferay Wins

* Reviewers scored Liferay higher when it comes to:
  * Better service and support
  * Easier integration and deployment
  * Better evaluation and contracting
* Regional SLA (Service-Level Agreement) reports - work with your regional support teams for average ticket times, resolution times, and satisfaction scoring. Customer onboarding and commitment post the deal is a critical winning factor for Liferay.
* Experience with the authenticated user experience - by comparing Liferay with Sitecore on the authenticated experience, we have a competitive advantage.
* Liferay is also natively built to work together, and according to what we hear from the market, Sitecore lacks any proper integration to many of their acquired capabilities.
* Liferay has a strong history of supporting enterprise customers with our core platform and has more experience than Sitecore in supporting the complexity and scale that enterprise requires.
