## Competitor Commonalities

Having reviewed some of Liferay’s main competitors, there are some clear commonalities:

* All four have acquired multiple companies to build their product suites, resulting in disjointed systems.
* Many have been criticized for their lack of clear strategy or commitment to customer success.
* Most have high costs associated with customizations, upgrades, and hosting.
* Many have a CMS background.  Because of this integration, security and account services have limited capabilities.

## What Makes Liferay Unique
