# The Ideal Customer Profile

This module introduces the Ideal Customer Profile for Liferay and summarizes the ideal customer profile for Liferay’s offerings in terms of the Customer’s 

1. Company and organization type
1. Vertical
1. Solution needs
1. Complexity
1. And other needs

This knowledge is designed to help Sellers be better equipped to prospect, and to pre-qualify an opportunity or RFI / RFQ successfully.

## Selling vs. Walking Away

It is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses that your organization has, and that the product you are selling has. 

It is not possible to win every opportunity unless there are unlimited resources available - and as such we need to be able to prioritize opportunities and prospects:

* Sometimes to solve the customer’s requirements will require using Liferay with another technology, or working with another partner because we would not be able to win alone.
* And sometimes we need to walk away from an opportunity if we’re not in a position to win it.
* Sales strategies that aren’t based on reality have a very low chance of succeeding. Realism and optimism are not opposite to each other.

“Bad news early is good news.” Confronting reality during the various stages of a sale helps in adjusting the strategy to ensure the win, or alternatively to re-allocate the time and money to an opportunity that can be won.

To meet clients’ buying criteria or to effectively change it, we need to understand their needs very well. And we need to understand how well our offering can meet those needs:

* It is unlikely that one vendor would meet every single requirement of every buyer. 
* It is the matter of meeting the needs well enough and better than the competitors.
* Pursuing major contracts is very expensive. 
* Finishing second costs as much as winning the contract, but there’s no reward at the end.
