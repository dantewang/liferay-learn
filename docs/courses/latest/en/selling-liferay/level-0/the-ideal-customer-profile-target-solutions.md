**At a Glance**

* Liferay shines when customers requirements:
  * Are complex
  * Have a focus on security and access control
  * Require an ability to scale
* Liferay is used across all industry verticals
* Liferay can be used to solve almost any business problem

## The Complete Platform for Tailored Solutions

Liferay DXP is - as it states in the name - a platform, and it is extremely flexible to cater for all sorts of needs.

Our out-of-the-box product capabilities can be used for almost any solution, however they are particularly suitable for certain types of solutions and use cases:

* Customer Portals
* Digital Commerce
* Supplier Portals
* Partner Portals
* External Websites
* Employee Portals

### Customer Portals

With Customer Portals and Self-Service Portals our customers can increase their profitability by empowering their end customers to self-serve.

Customers can lower their customer service costs and boost sales, while providing the end customer with an exceptional customer experience. Our horizontal portal background makes Liferay shine amongst many other DXP vendors in the portal use cases.

### Digital Commerce

With native commerce capabilities working seamlessly with digital self-service our Customers can grow their revenues by simplifying buying for their end customers and encourage repeat orders. They also benefit from the wide variety of OOTB capabilities especially designed for complex B2B scenarios.

Some DXPs have a commerce background but it is usually a B2C commerce background. The combination of portal heritage with OOTB B2B Commerce functionalities is unique.

### Supplier Portals

With a Supplier Portal our Customers can simplify the vendor support and increase their own profitability.

By centralizing where their vendors can share product information, availability and pricing, and easily share information on programs and promotions with them, their vendors can save time and be up to date with offers etc.

Additionally they can help their own staff to be more productive by providing visibility on all transactions and they can also monitor their vendors service levels.

### Partner Portals

With a Partner Portal the Customer can support their partners’ sales and technical teams with sharing access to relevant content, promotions, and recommendations.

They can save on service costs by helping their partners find answers faster themselves and by allowing partners to update their information or by providing secure online access to sensitive documents such as prices, contracts and invoices.

By integrating with other platforms, such as CRM, it is possible to automate lead routing, MDF workflows and more.

### External Websites

In many ways Self-Service starts from even before a customer has logged in, or po

Also when there are several digital touch points in play, e.g on top of web there’s also Kiosks, Chatbots, mobile, email →  LR can orchestrate the systems required for these channels. Most pure CMS vendors (regardless of how fancy they make it look), cannot handle this very well and Liferay beats them hands down once it becomes about associated application management and not just content.

Liferay’s multi-tenancy capabilities are well appreciated by those customers who need a lot of sites.

### Modern Intranets

With a modern employee portal our customers can have their employees share, collaborate, and communicate on one platform and keep everyone in their organization productive, self-sufficient, and connected. The portal heritage of Liferay DXP makes it particularly suitable for various Intranet use cases in the same way that it is well suited to Customer Self-Service use cases

Many common intranet platforms lack personalization features or modularity or easy duplication of pages, all of which are readily available with Liferay DXP.

### Other Solutions

Of course, the solutions we’ve covered so far do not represent every Solution that can be solved with Liferay. Liferay DXP is also used, for example, as an integration platform, agent portal, student portal, and more.

## Demographics and Other Factors

There are also other factors that make an opportunity well suited or less well suited for Liferay:

* Company Size
* Location
* Budget
* Buyer Roles

### Company Size

A company’s size is based on a number of criteria, including the number of customers they have, the number of employees they have, the number of vendors they work with, students, partners, agents, etc.

There’s probably not enough value for the investment of annual subscription and work of building a custom solution on top of the Liferay platform if the company is a small business with simple offerings and a handful of customers.

However, there is no absolute point when a company’s size becomes big enough - or where they are too small - it also depends on the market and the market maturity.

There are markets where the expectation of great digital self service is very strong which means that even smaller companies need to invest in it to survive. Internally we use from 150 to 300 million USD / EUR Annual Revenue as a guideline.

In the case of an intranet or a student portal it could be around 1000 employees or students. For the number of customers or partners it is even more difficult to determine the threshold: it really depends on the solution need and the complexity of processes to be digitized.

As noted earlier - complexity in the requirements is good for Liferay.

### Location

Liferay offers support, services, documentation, contracts, and the product itself in many languages but not every language. Where there is an absolute requirement for a language that we do not cover directly, the best option is to partner up with someone who can fill that gap.

Local legislation is a factor - with GDPR being the most commonly used example. Liferay’s offerings, including our PaaS and SaaS offerings, are GDPR compliant.

In some cases the physical location that data is stored in is a key factor. Liferay’s Cloud data centers are located in strategically important locations, but we do not have data centers in every single country. In these cases we can offer our self-hosted offering to remove the problem - or potentially add new data centers where there is sufficient demand.

An enterprise grade DXP such as Liferay is a good option particularly when the buyer is a global company needing 24/7 support.

### Budget

Most often bigger companies have bigger budgets and smaller companies smaller budgets, but the size of the buyer does not necessarily equal the size of the budget.

It is advisable to ask for a budget range or “what size of an investment are you considering for this project” quite early in the discussion if there’s a doubt related to sufficient funding.

### Buyer Roles

Understanding the Roles of the people you are working with is critical.  Business leaders, IT or marketing people will have different levels of influence and buying control. If the C-level are included in the meetings it is more likely you have access to a key decision maker.  Conversely, if there are external consultants, advisors or influencers we may be in a weaker position.

There’s a wise saying: “You cannot sell to someone who cannot buy”. Even if your main contact is a really nice person and really likes Liferay, if they don’t have the funds and if they do not have decision making power or access to all decision makers, your chances of success will be reduced.

You need to have different types of buying influences to win a deal and usually there are several people and several roles impacting the decisions.
