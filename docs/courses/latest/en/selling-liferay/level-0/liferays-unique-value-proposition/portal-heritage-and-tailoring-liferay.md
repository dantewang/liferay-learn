## Portal Heritage

The DXP landscape consists of a majority of vendors who started out as Content Management Systems providers, others who came from a CRM or ERP background.  Liferay is one of the few with a strong horizontal portal heritage.  

Liferay’s portal heritage provides us with a very unique perspective that can be summarized in a few key capabilities:  

* Strong Integration
* Customer relationship focus
* Secure data handling
* Digital agility

### Integration Capabilities

Digital experience platforms allow companies to embrace digital transformation. A key to effective digital transformation is providing seamless experiences by breaking down the barriers between disparate systems.

Portal-heritage platforms like Liferay have core capabilities to integrate to backend and legacy systems. These give customers, employees and other end users access to the data they need across multiple applications within a company.

For example, customer data locked in a CRM or company’s marketing automation tool can be unified and shared through a portal-heritage DXP. This saves both businesses and customers time and effort and helps companies to better understand and support their target audience.

### Long-term Customer Relationships Focus

Portals connect businesses with target audiences through secure interfaces. These experiences are also highly personalized with each user accessing the content and capabilities that they need.
CMS technology traditionally focuses on serving content to anonymous prospects and can struggle with these authenticated experiences.

### Secure Data Handling Capabilities

Unlike CMSs, Portals support large numbers of users and flows of information, often containing sensitive details from customers and businesses. Portal-heritage DXPs are founded in systems that are encrypted and ready to both store and analyze data for secure and insightful information management.

### Digital Agility

As highlighted by Gartner, portals can be used as a common architectural framework, allowing companies to build a website and quickly reuse the framework they have created in order to build more touchpoints.

This can ensure that all their digital presences are uniform in functionality and appearance, which also saves time and money by avoiding a rebuild from scratch. 

By turning a portal-heritage digital experience platform into a solutions factory, Customers can quickly advance their digital strategies while maintaining control over the quality of individual experiences.

## Easy to Tailor

Liferay is recognized as the most flexible and extensible DXP available.  

The exact approaches for tailoring and customizing Liferay have changed over time, with each step offering improved ease of use without sacrificing flexibility. We can summarize the evolution in extending Liferay as follows:

* Modifying the source
* EXT environment
* Plugins SDK
* Extension Points
* Client Extensions

### Evolution of Extensions

Initially all users built the product from source code so could change and customize how the portal performed.  This ultimate flexibility came with the cost of users potentially introducing their own bugs, while making it hard to easily upgrade to newer versions.

Each step forward reduced the knowledge needed to extend the platform, while reducing the likelihood of introducing issues.  Initially the EXT Environment was used for customization before the Plugins SDK was introduced.  

Liferay DXP 7.0 introduced OSGi and in doing so allowed customizations to move to a modular model, which allowed Extension Points to be added into the platform for commonly extended functionality.  For example, for implementing new Payment Methods or Order Rules in the Commerce Context, or new storage mechanisms for storing Documents and Media.  

All of these improvements however still created challenges with respect to Upgrading to a later version.  The latest step in this process is with the introduction of Client Extensions as our most powerful and maintainable extension mechanism.  

Client Extensions are separated from the core Liferay code supporting easy upgrades and for Liferay DXP to be delivered as a SaaS platform.

## Delivering Experiences for Many Audiences and Use Cases

Many DXP vendors focus primarily on consumer-based solutions such as public websites. Liferay’s portal heritage enables us to additionally focus on business-based solutions requiring authenticated experiences combining data and functionality from multiple systems.

Example business-focussed authenticated solutions include:

* Customer Portals
* Supplier Portals
* Partner Portals
* Intranet Solutions

But of course, this is far from a complete list.  

All of these B2B solutions typically feature inherent complexity in requirements and integration needs.  By focusing on solutions that can handle this complexity, Liferay is well positioned to address the most common B2C use cases as well.
