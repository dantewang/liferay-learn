## Key Challenges for Insurance

Much like the Financial Services industry, each insurer is unique, however they share many common challenges:

* How to serve **digital savvy customers **across **omnichannel experiences**
* How to **empower employees**
* How to **integrate legacy systems** to equip **agents** for success
* How to **remain competitive**

Insurers today are challenged with serving digital savvy customers who are demanding a consistent customer experience across any device, at any time of the night or day.  Liferay helps to quickly create streamlined and connected experiences modern policyholders demand. Liferay also allows them to expedite the creation and customization of an insured portal solution by utilizing pre-built capabilities and years of expertise delivering solutions to insurers.

Insurers also struggle to give their employees the tools needed to serve customers effectively. Digital workplaces built on Liferay DXP enable teams to collaborate and perform their jobs effectively, increasing employee engagement, and satisfaction.

Like many other industries, insurers are also struggling to integrate legacy systems.  Lack of integration leads to disjointed applications and claims processes that are hard to automate. Liferay overcomes integration difficulties with a platform unparalleled for its interoperability and flexibility. Liferay can unite existing core insurance systems and technology to work alongside emerging InsurTech and future innovation.

Finally, insurers need to remain competitive. They need to stay ahead of changing risks and an evolving market with a flexible platform built to adapt for change. Features like OpenAPI compliance and a wide range of development tools help Liferay customers accelerate future innovations and changing business models.
