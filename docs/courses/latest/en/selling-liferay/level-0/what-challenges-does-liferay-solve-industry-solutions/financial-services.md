# Financial Services

Much like Manufacturing, Financial Services is an industry where Liferay has a lot of experience and a lot of success, which is based to a large degree because of Liferay’s robust and secure Java based platform.

Financial Services customers are typically very traditional when it comes to their preferred technology.  However, even if the IT department is very traditional, their business users expect a modern, personalized, and omni-channel experience.

## Key Challenges for Financial Services

Liferay has worked with a wide range of customers in the Financial Services industry solving many different challenges for them. While each is unique, some common challenges are seen repeatedly:

* How to offer a **superior customer experience**
* How to support **security** and **compliance** requirements
* How to **keep up** with **competitors**
* How to **empower sellers** to **enable customer delight**

Offering a superior customer service experience for customers has been becoming increasingly important as they interact more online.  Those customers still want support and guidance, but now expect the same level of service and personalization whether they are visiting in person or banking online.

Another challenge facing Financial Services customers is integrating with, and getting the most out of their Legacy Systems.  These challenges might be due to technology incompatibility, data inconsistency, complexity or even just the cost and time that it takes.

For many customers it may not be practical, or take too long, to migrate from these legacy systems.  They therefore need to find a way to bring these systems together and deliver value to their employees and customers.  This is a challenge that Liferay is well suited to tackle due to our heritage as a horizontal portal and integration platform.

No discussion of financial services challenges would be complete without addressing the increasing threats of cyber-attacks or regulatory requirements.  Many financial services companies place a very high value on working with proven technologies and vendors, and this is where Liferay’s track record of delivering to banking customers and the maturity of the underlying technologies can really shine.

Finally, many Financial Services customers are looking for ways to provide more personalized advice and guidance to enable _their_ customers to make informed financial decisions.  They need to find ways to scale this personalized experience while also looking for ways to make their customer agents and relationship managers more productive.  Liferay’s advanced personalization capabilities and self-service capabilities can help customers do just that.
