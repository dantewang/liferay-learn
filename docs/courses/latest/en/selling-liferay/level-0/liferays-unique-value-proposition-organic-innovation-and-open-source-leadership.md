## Background

This module explains Liferay’s Unique Value Proposition, as well as the Unique Selling Propositions or USPs that support that value proposition.  

While many other competitors claim to deliver the same value, only Liferay provides the unique combination of characteristics and traits that set us apart and help Liferay provide value to our customers.  

## What is a Value Proposition anyway?

Software vendors often use the term Value Proposition or Value Prop, along with terms like USP or UVP. To avoid confusion it is helpful to understand the definitions for these terms.

A **Value Proposition** is a statement that clearly conveys the product a vendor promises to deliver to their customers.  A value proposition motivates potential customers to choose one vendor over another. It should speak to a customer’s challenge and make the case for your company as the problem-solver.  

To put it even more simply it is the short statement that answers the question, “What do you do?”  

A **Unique Selling Proposition** or USP is something that differentiates products and a brand from competitors and allows a vendor to gain a competitive advantage by positioning offerings and the company in a unique way.  

USPs help to support the Value Proposition and highlight benefits that target audiences perceive as valuable.

While the wording of each vendor’s Value Proposition will be different, many vendors will be proposing the same value. USPs meanwhile are the key differentiators that set one vendor apart from competitors and establish them in the market.

## What is Liferay’s Value Proposition?  

![Liferay provides a complete platform without sacrificing speed, flexibility, or cost.](./liferays-unique-value-proposition-organic-innovation-and-open-source-leadership/images/01.png)

As stated on liferay.com, Liferay’s Value Propositions is that Liferay is the Complete Platform for Tailored Solutions. Liferay allows our customers to create custom digital experiences without sacrificing speed, flexibility, or cost.

This statement captures the unique values that Liferay has been providing for years.  From the very beginning Liferay has been more than a portal, it has been a platform that technical users could customize as needed to solve almost any business problem.  

At times, the ability to customize has been both a benefit and a challenge.  It provides complete flexibility, but can create a burden on the teams tasked with maintaining and upgrading the platform.  

Liferay has focused on enabling Liferay Experience Cloud to be used to develop solutions that can be tailored to customers’ unique needs, without modifying the core of the platform.

Or in other words, to customize the digital experience, not the platform.

## Organic Innovation

Many different aspects support our overall Value Proposition but one of the most important is the fact that Liferay has evolved organically using home grown technology. Liferay has:

* Been developed entirely in-house
* A consistent user experience
* Consistent configuration and APIs

All of which leads to a lower total cost of ownership - or TCO.

### Built in-house

All of the major features and functionality of Liferay DXP were developed by Liferay engineers or contributed by Liferay community members and reviewed by Liferay engineers ensuring that our technology is consistent and follows well established patterns and coding conventions.  

Most importantly this means that all of the different parts of Liferay technology are designed to work together seamlessly.  Products built through acquisition are much less likely to operate in this seamless fashion.

### Consistent User Experience

For our customers this means that both the user experience and the developer experience are very consistent.  As users move throughout the user interface, the features and functionality behave in a very predictable way and the controls look very familiar - which results in quicker and easier user training.

### Consistent Configuration and APIs

For developers and IT professionals supporting Liferay, the configuration capabilities and APIs are also consistent and predictable.  Once the frameworks and patterns used to extend or support one area of the platform have been learned, that knowledge can be reused with other areas of the platform.  

### Lower Total Cost of Ownership

All of these capabilities combined help to allow for smaller teams to support the solution and lower overall total cost of ownership when compared to vendors whose platforms have grown through acquisition of new companies or technologies.  
These platforms often have inconsistent user experiences and inconsistent technology landscapes.  

## Open Source Leadership

At the core of Liferay is our Open Source background.  Liferay has consistently been one of the top companies contributing to Open Source. Liferay has benefited greatly from the contributions provided by our vibrant and active global user community.

Community contribution helps Liferay with:

* Solving Issues
* Enhancing the platform
* Security

All of which extends and amplifies the capabilities of Liferay’s own employees.

### Solving Issues

Early adopters in the community help our QA department to identify issues more quickly and in many cases also provide fixes to those issues, which benefits all users of the platform, whether community users, or Enterprise Subscribers.  

### Product Ideas

Liferay’s Documentation is improved through community blog posts along with capability discussions in message boards. Community feature requests and product ideas also serve to extend the reach of our own Product Management department and validate existing or under-development features.

### Security

Liferay DXP’s source code is publicly available. This provides greater transparency to our customers compared to just taking our word that it is secure.
Customers, or 3rd party experts employed by them, can examine the source code themselves and can be more confident than they could with a proprietary solution.

## What’s Next

Next we’ll cover Liferay’s portal heritage and evolution in extension approaches.
