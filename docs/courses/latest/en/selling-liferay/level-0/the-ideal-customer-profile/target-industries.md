### Financial Services

Liferay is used by many of the largest Financial Services Institutions in the world.

This vertical is highly regulated, there’s a great need for multiple and complex integrations between core platforms and digital experiences, and the nature of data and information processed is confidential and sensitive.

The expectation from the end customer of a FSI, whether consumer or business-focused, is to have effortless access to their own accounts, data, investments, loans etc and a requirement to be able to self-serve at any time, any day anywhere and for that to be done securely.

Some of the solution needs in FSI include:

* Self-Service Customer Portals
* Wealth Management Platforms
* Intranets
* And much more

The enterprise grade flexibility and scalability as well as the interoperability and security components of the Liferay platform meet the needs of FSI companies well.

### Insurance

There are lots of similarities between the Financial Services and Insurance industries.  Insurance is also highly regulated, there’s a need for complex integrations, and the data is sensitive.

In addition to the needs and requirements of Financial Services, there are some industry specific expectations too:

* Self-service is critical. To be able to view and renew policies and get quotes for and acquire new ones
* Quoting/purchasing policies also adds a digital commerce element
* The need to provide efficient self-service tools for agents and brokers.

Liferay’s commerce capabilities, forms and workflow tools help insurance companies in meeting these needs.

### Manufacturing

Within the manufacturing industry one of the greatest customer experience needs is to have robust B2B digital commerce tools, along with the opportunity to have digital commerce seamlessly working with other self-service capabilities as part of digital customer experience.

Liferay’s native Digital Commerce functionalities coupled with robust DXP capabilities enables manufacturers to have tutorials, knowledge bases, product catalogs, community forums, support tickets, workflows and B2B commerce capabilities in a single platform.

Liferay offers a wealth of features particularly suitable for manufacturers and other B2B commerce scenarios such as the Bill Of Materials or “Shop by Diagram”, buyer approval workflows, contract pricing and discounts etc.

### Healthcare

Within both private and public healthcare, there is a great demand for enabling digital self-service both for patients and health care professionals. Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the data, granular user roles and access management and other account services are a must.

There’s also a great deal of complexity and need for integration to other systems and is a very regulated industry.

### Government & Public Sector

In the Public sector it is almost guaranteed that there are going to be legacy technologies living alongside requirements for new citizen portals.

Therefore the possibility to bring data from legacy systems into a user-friendly platform is a key requirement - meaning that integration and interoperability capabilities are important.

This industry is in some cases even more highly regulated than others - bringing complexity to even simple projects - for example accessibility capabilities are almost always required.  Liferay DXP is accessible by design which makes it easier to meet these requirements.

Liferay’s Open Source roots also attracts Public Sector buyers. Many projects in this sector start out on Community Edition, but once the project has grown in terms of importance, criticality, complexity or volume, the need for enterprise subscription services to provide benefits such as legal assurance, support, product updates, and further product capabilities becomes significant.

Customers are also attracted by our active open-source community which contributes to and improves the code base and many of our Public Sector customers are part of this community and contribute themselves, particularly when considering Education as part of this vertical.

### Energy & Utilities

The needs of Energy and Utilities companies are not that different from the other industries - there’s a great need to streamline customer self-service processes and to provide personalized experience through customer portals 24/7.

Lowering costs to serve and increasing end customer satisfaction are the main drivers. This can be achieved by allowing end customers to manage their own accounts, pay online, and solve problems without needing to contact a representative.

## Example Customers
