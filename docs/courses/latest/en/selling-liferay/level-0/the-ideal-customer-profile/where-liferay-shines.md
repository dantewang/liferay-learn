# The Ideal Customer Profile - Where Liferay Shines

**At a Glance**

* Liferay shines when customers requirements:
  * Are complex
  * Have a focus on security and access control
  * Require an ability to scale
* Liferay is used across all industry verticals
* Liferay can be used to solve almost any business problem

## Where Does Liferay Shine?

Liferay provides a rich and sophisticated set of capabilities which can be used to address almost any business problem.  But, there are certain characteristics of Customers and their business problems that are particularly suited to Liferay:

* Complexity
* Security
* Enterprise

![Liferay excels as a solution when Complexity, Security, and Enterprise scale are factors for a deal.](./the-ideal-customer-profile-where-liferay-shines/images/01.png)

### Complexity

When a customer has needs and requirements that are complex - and who understands, or who we can help to understand, that meeting those needs will come with a price tag - we are in a stronger position.

With complexity we mean things like:

* Lots of different types of user profiles
* Multiple usage scenarios
* Multiple processes and complex workflows
* Many integrations
* Also worth mentioning are B2B usage scenarios

Complexity does not mean we should make it more complex. But we should be able to help the buyer to appreciate the complexity of their needs and understand that ”a simple product” (offered by a competitor) doesn’t make their complex needs disappear.

If the buyer needs a platform that can serve as an extranet e.g. for partner-facing scenarios, a supplier, or a reseller portal with self-service elements -  that is complex.  And that complexity is good for Liferay.

It is particularly important to mention B2B: in many cases these are far more complex than B2C scenarios.

Think about B2B buying and selling vs B2C:

* The sales cycles are longer
* There are bigger buyer teams involved
* There are approval processes and
* Complicated contracts governing pricing, deliveries, and many other terms  

Collaboration and knowledge sharing functionality are prominent considerations for the B2B use case.

B2B is complex even with smaller deals. Compare that to a B2C buying where, for example, you decide you need a car: I go to a site to browse for a car of my liking or I might go and do a test drive, and if I like it, I buy the car.

Providing I have money or sufficient credit rating the whole process can happen really fast and I do not need to ask anyone’s opinion, approval or even read the contract (because they would not change it for me anyway)

### Security

Liferay is a strong option when the customer has a need for high security and stringent access controls.

Security overall is an area on which analyst firms like Gartner etc. have repeatedly given Liferay high scores.

We have had lots of success across industries where security is the top requirement.  For example in Financial Services, Government sites and other Public Portals, Healthcare, etc.

All these have extremely high security expectations, governance expectations and compliance requirements.

Liferay’s capabilities for account services in the form of customer profile management, registration, login and password management capabilities in an authenticated, logged-in experience meet those needs and expectations.

The security landscape changes rapidly - and Security is complicated. Unless the buyer, the prospect or customer are operating in the security industry or have a very mature and dedicated security practice, most companies are behind and are underestimating the threats that are out there. 

Often they do not have the most recent state-of-the-art tools or knowledge of hacktivists, cyber criminals, state sponsored hackers and so on. This becomes increasingly important with SaaS and PaaS deployments.

With Liferay Experience Cloud we provide as part of the SaaS subscription DDoS protection (Distributed Denial of Services), Web Application Firewall, and much more.

Security, access control and support for governance policies is vital for any DXP. While governance is not a “feature” as such, a DXP plays a role in helping the organization using the DXP to monitor, inform and adapt governance policies - including delegation of roles and responsibilities, compliance with accessibility, privacy regulations and so on.

Security is related to governance and is a differentiator in light of the DXP’s role in providing access to and interaction with a wide range of internal and external information sources.

### Enterprise

Enterprise customers need scalability because they have lots of:

* Markets
* Users
* Customers
* Needs

They also have a huge need for flexibility, and Enterprise grade digital experience needs cannot be met with non-customizable turnkey solutions that are ordered from the web, turned on and are ready to use.

Enterprise customers also need:

* A platform on top of which the enterprise customer can have their solution built and tailored to their needs in a flexible manner
* A platform and solutions that can adapt to their needs and processes - not the other way around
* Strong Integration and extension capabilities.
* Well-documented, well-designed, operable, extensible, deep and broad RESTful APIs to enable various types of integrations are required by enterprise customers to connect a DXP with relevant other applications, and services.

## What’s Next

Next we’ll look at the industry verticals that Liferay is particularly common in.
