## Definition of a Solution

A solution is a common business need or a set of challenges that Liferay Experience Cloud is well-suited to address.

## Land and Expand

Most customers come to Liferay looking for a specific solution. Over time they often find additional business challenges that Liferay can help them solve.

For example, in one common pattern, a customer finds Liferay when looking for a modern intranet solution. After the customer implements their intranet, they realize the same features and capabilities (and the same subscription) could also help them solve challenges on their public website or on an authenticated customer portal experience.
