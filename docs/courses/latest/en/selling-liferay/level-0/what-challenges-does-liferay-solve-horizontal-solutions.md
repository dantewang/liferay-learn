# What Challenges Does Liferay Solve - Horizontal Solutions

**At a Glance**

* Liferay is great for Horizontal Solutions like:
  * Customer Portals
  * Digital Commerce Sites
  * External Websites
  * Supplier Portals
  * Partner Portals
  * Modern Intranets
  * And more
* Customers often start with one project and later add others
* Each of these solutions draw on many of Liferay’s core capabilities

## Background

In this module we will be learning more about the types of business challenges that Liferay is well suited to solve.  It’s important to note that one of Liferay’s strengths is its flexibility and that means that you really can use Liferay to solve just about any problem for any industry.

However, there are some solutions and industries where we are a particularly good fit and we want to focus on new business opportunities that align with those solutions and industries to have the highest chance of success.

## Definition of a Solution

For the purposes of this module we will define a solution as a common business need or a set of challenges that Liferay Experience Cloud is well suited to address or solve.

## Land and Expand

It is important to keep in mind that most customers originally come to Liferay looking for a specific solution.  Over time they will often find additional business challenges that Liferay can help them to solve.

As an example, a common pattern might be for a customer to find Liferay when looking for a modern intranet solution.  Once that solution has been implemented they realize that the same features and capabilities (and the very same subscription) could also help them to solve challenges on their public website or it may help them to provide an authenticated customer portal experience.

![Starting with a basic solution and gradually extending Liferay's usage within a company is a great approach to expansion and growth.](./what-challenges-does-liferay-solve-horizontal-solutions/images/01.png)
