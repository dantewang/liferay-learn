# Liferay vs. Enterprise Application Categories

**At a Glance**

* Liferay competes against many competitors, grouped into:
  * Enterprise Suites
  * Composable Point-Solutions
  * Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP)
  * Digital Experience Platforms (DXP)
* Focus on different aspects depending on the competitor being faced

## Liferay vs. Enterprise Suites

When competing against an enterprise suite vendor, focus on the following:

* **Best-of-breed**: Suite vendors are best-of-suite, not best-of-breed DXP because there is no specific focus on DXP. Liferay also provides best-of-breed Portal and CMS capabilities. For example, Liferay is a Headless CMS leader in the latest [IDC MarketScape for Hybrid-Headless CMS](https://www.liferay.com/idc-marketscape-for-hybrid-headless-cms).
* **Customizability**: Enterprise suites are only customizable within the limited boundaries of their monolithic architecture. By comparison, Liferay is completely customizable and can be part of a fully flexible composable architecture.
* **Interoperability & Composability**: Enterprise suites are designed and integrated with their own technology stack. Although APIs are provided, enterprise suites are typically not designed to be part of a composable architecture. Liferay is designed to integrate with other applications and to be part of a compatible architecture
* **Total cost of ownership (TCO)**: With enterprise suites you have to buy into their technology stack, often paying for functionality you don't need.
* **Vendor lock-in**: One of the strongest arguments against Enterprise Suite vendors is their lock-in strategy. Once a customer has invested in an enterprise suite it is very difficult to extend the application without using the suite components. This makes suite vendors expensive and rigid and very difficult to move away from. Further than this many suite vendors have actually come to Liferay to extend their own rigid suite architectures.
* **Brand name & Turnkey solutions**: Liferay’s main weakness against Enterprise suites are mainly around brand visibility and analyst ratings. Suite vendors will highlight that Liferay is not a turnkey solution and there are product gaps around Analytics and AI. Liferay’s counterargument is that together with our partners, we can customize and integrate to provide a complete and tailored solution for our customers.

## Liferay vs. Composable Point Solutions

When competing against composable point solutions, focus on the following:

* **Complexity & Time-to-market**: To achieve a complete enterprise solution for customers, a composable point solution like a headless CMS will have to be integrated with other solutions, such as a Commerce point solution. Although this composability provides the ultimate flexibility, it will take time to select and integrate these various components.
* **Accountability & Maintainability**: Another aspect prospects should consider is that all these composable solutions are provided by different vendors, all with their own terms and conditions, so the complete solution will be complex, difficult to maintain, and there is no single accountability for the solution as a whole.
* **Deployment options**: Composability, and the MACH alliance, are based on the cloud native principle. SaaS is not the right option for everyone. Remember that Liferay provides SaaS, PaaS and Self-Hosted options.
* **Enterprise grade**: Other important aspects for enterprise solutions are security, scalability, and compliance. When creating an enterprise architecture based on several different solutions from different vendors, the complete solution is only as secure, scalable and compliant as the weakest solution within that architecture. Liferay is a fully integrated DXP which has been in use by some of the largest enterprises for over 20 years.
* **Point solution cost**: Composable vendors will argue that a DXP is more expensive than their point solution. If a customer just needs a CMS, then this statement might be true. However, no enterprise customer just needs a CMS. There will always be a need to integrate with other solutions like Commerce, which will be an additional cost with composable vendors.

## Liferay vs. Low-Code Application Platforms

LCAP vendors allow the quick creation of applications to automate business processes, but there are some restrictions and disadvantages to be aware of:

* **Best-of-breed DXP**: Generic business processes are easily automated with LCAP, but core DXP functionality like CMS and Portal is typically not available and will have to be integrated. Liferay provides market leading DXP capabilities.
* **Customizability & Integration**: The main advantage of LCAP is the ease and speed at which a non-technical user can automate business processes. However, low code has severe limitations. For more advanced customizations, code is required. The same applies to Integrations - LCAP can be integrated with other systems but not to the extent that is possible with composable code-based solutions.
* **Vendor lock-in**: Similar to Suite Vendors, LCAPs aim to automate business processes across the Enterprise and are configured and customized through their own user interface, which also leads to vendor lock-in.
* **Deployment options**: Liferay has more flexible deployment options with SaaS, PaaS, and Self-Hosted, which may not be the case with LCAPs.
* **Security & Shadow IT**: when business users start building apps or automatic workflows without any IT oversight, security and compliance can be a real concern. This can also lead to shadow IT, where there is no visibility on what additional work streams are created.
* **Analyst Cautions**: Liferay weakness against LCAP vendors is our _perceived_ focus on DXP only. Analysts do not currently consider Liferay to be an LCAP vendor, for example. LCAP vendors will highlight that Liferay is not a turnkey solution and that the product only has DXP capabilities. Liferay’s counterargument is that we can customize and integrate with best-of-breed solutions to provide a complete and tailored solution for our customers, and the platform includes native low code capabilities.

### Liferay vs. Integrated Digital Experience Platforms

Liferay has traditionally been considered to be an integrated DXP, but, even when compared to other DXP vendors there are some additional advantages:

* **Composability & Integration**: Liferay is fully composable through its Headless APIs. This allows Liferay to be part of a fully composable architecture. DXPs are traditionally Monolithic and do not provide such flexibility to customize and integrate.
* **Customizability with no-Code and code**: Liferay is market leading when it comes to tailoring solutions with either No-Code capabilities or Code-based Client Extensions, which is not the case for many Monolithic DXP vendors.
* **Deployment options**: Liferay provides full deployment option flexibility with SaaS, PaaS, and Self-Hosted deployment offerings. 
* **Organically Grown**: Most of Liferay’s competitors’ offerings are based on acquisitions, which are then integrated to create a monolithic architecture. 
* **Open Source**: Virtually none of Liferay’s DXP competitors are open source. Liferay has always been Open Source and has therefore access to an open source community and associated innovation that comes with that community.
* **Product gaps**: Other DXP vendors may be more vocal about integrations with latest innovations like AI. It is important to highlight that Liferay has similar integrations.
