# Level 1 for Technical Sales Roles

Welcome to the Level 1 Selling Liferay learning path for Technical Sales Roles!

This module focuses on Sales Engineers, taking the base knowledge learned in [Level 0](./level-0.md) to enable you to prepare and run a successful demo of Liferay.

## Expected Outcomes

The singular goal for this learning path is to enable a Sales Engineer to deliver a business-focussed 30-minute demo of Liferay using one of the pre-built demos.

By the end of this course you’ll have learned

* How to do the right technical discovery so that the demo meets the needs of the prospect
* How to talk about and show public pages, authenticating to Liferay, and then showcasing authenticated experiences
* The really simple tricks that can be used to tailor the styling of any demo to align with the prospect’s colors, logo, etc.
* How to expand an existing demo with a business application using Liferay Objects
* How to talk about extending Liferay, what the deployment strategies are, and what the benefits of each strategy is
* Know how to analyze and talk about Liferay success stories
* The dos and don’ts of running a demo

## Roles

This learning path is for technical sales roles including, but not limited to

* Sales Engineers (SEs)
* Implementation Consultants
* Other technical selling roles

Because the approach is to use a pre-existing demo, with minimal, code-free customization, other sellers will also find this valuable, including:

* Account Executives (AEs)
* Customer Success Managers (CSMs)
* Other roles who may present or demo Liferay to prospects and customers

## Prerequisites

We recommend completion of [Level 0](./level-0.md) before commencing any of the Level 1 modules.

Note that this course does not intend to teach someone how to be a Sales Engineer, so some level of Technical Sales experience is recommended before commencing.

Start level 1 with learning what to find out during a [Discovery Call](./level-1-technical/discovery-calls.md).
