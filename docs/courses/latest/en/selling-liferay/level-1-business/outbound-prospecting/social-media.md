# Prospecting Tools - Social Media

The next tool for outbound prospecting is social media, primarily LinkedIn.  Social media is often used improperly and ineffectively.

## Using LinkedIn Effectively

Most people go wrong with LinkedIn because of a lack of creativity, along with a lack of persistence with it.

When talking with sales people about how they’re using LinkedIn, mostly the full extent of their interaction with a prospect is to send a connection request.

Connecting with a prospect on LinkedIn is a great place to start, but it’s where efforts should start, not end. Once a connection is in place, be creative and interact with the prospect’s posts:

* Engage with them
* Make comments
* Like their posts
* etc.

And then it is important to continue the interaction.

## Getting the Most Out of LinkedIn

Most people think of LinkedIn for connections and messages. However, LinkedIn now offers multiple ways of communicating by sending

* Messages
* Videos
* Voice notes

Like any tool, you will get more out of LinkedIn by putting more into it.

And, like the other approaches, a single contact is largely ineffective. According to a recent survey, “The highest performing cadences leveraged at least two social touches.”

Closer to home, Matt Wawaro, Liferay’s Director for Business Development, explained that at his previous organization they noticed that over 60% of the people that responded on LinkedIn, responded after the sixth message to them.

Even with this level of persistence, prospects were apologizing for not responding back sooner. 

Despite what you might think, persistence on LinkedIn works.

## Other Tips for Effective Use of LinkedIn

The language you use to interact with a prospect via Social Media must be tuned to respect cultural and individual factors. One effective method is to examine the “social tone” of each prospect because that helps to fine-tune the tone you use when reaching out. 

Similarly to phone and email, you must understand cultural differences and unwritten rules. The tone could be slightly different in different channels. One particular caution is that if the prospect is informal in their social tone and when they make comments on their connections’ posts, it doesn’t mean you should. As noted earlier, be careful being on first-name terms with Europeans in particular. 

## Examples of Effective Social Messaging 

When reaching out through social media, it is important to offer value. Leverage the tools and features of the platform to share information about how Liferay solves real-world problems---problems prospect’s organizations probably face today:

* **Lack of Consistency** \
Brand matters, and so does user experience
* **Breaking down barriers** \
Data silos create inefficiency and drive costs up
* **Grow Your Relationship** \
For B2B, the initial sale is only the beginning. 

### Lack of Consistency

This messaging must vary depending on the role of the contact, but many organizations struggle with a lack of consistency. Engaging with prospects about the importance of brand and consistency across the customer journey might be of interest. 

### Breaking Down Silos

Another common challenge many companies face is breaking down the data silos that invariably arise over time. These data silos create terrible inefficiencies and drive up costs, and many prospects can relate. This is particularly common with large and complex organizations, and even more so with organizations that have grown through acquisition.

### Growing Relationships

If the prospect sells large or complex products, the initial sale could be only the beginning. Engaging with those customers and keeping them coming back for additional aftermarket sales is key, and Liferay has compelling features that can help grow those relationships.

## Leverage Liferay Campaign Messaging

When Liferay marketing prepares campaigns, these are given to partners as well as “a campaign in a box.” In each campaign is suggested messaging to avoid having to start from scratch. 

Partners can connect with their Channel Account Managers to get these campaigns. Liferay sellers should connect with your local marketing team. 

As part of Liferay’s quarterly product releases, we provide suggested messages for prospects. Depending on the context, these can work as discussion points in a successful call, on an email, or in a social media reach-out or comment.
