# Prospecting Tools - Phone

The second tool that every seller must learn to master is the phone. Yes, Cold Calling. Despite the fear that this phrase raises in Sales team members, and the propaganda about cold calling on sites like LinkedIn, cold calling is not dead!  

## Common Mistakes

The most common mistakes made with respect to Phoning prospects are:

* Not making enough calls
* Not leaving Voicemails
* Calling from a foreign number
* Calling on a Public Holiday
* Calling several times on the same day
* Not preparing well enough

### Not Making Enough Calls

Most callers are not persistent enough with their prospect over the phone. For example, according to [ZoomInfo](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/sales/sales-follow-up-statistics) “95% of all converted leads are reached by the sixth call attempt. Yet 40% of sellers stop after 2 calls.”

### Not Leaving Voicemails

According to [Salesloft](https://salesloft.com/resources/blog/5-prospect-channels-your-sales-process-needs/), “Voicemail immediately followed by an email have reported a 10% increase in email conversions.”

The purpose of leaving voicemails is not to receive a phone call back, rather, you should leave your prospect Voicemails to improve your reply rate on email.

### Example Voicemail

The following provides an example of what a good voicemail to a prospect could sound like:

> "James, there's no need for you to call me back. I'm about to hit ‘send’ on an email to you with the subject line ‘Checking In’. You can respond with what day and time works best for you. Talk soon. This is Matt Wawro with Liferay."

An important note with the above is that the structure of this message, and indeed emails that are sent, will need to vary in different countries due to cultural differences. For example, in many European countries people might not like to be addressed using their first name when the contact is from a stranger. A better alternative might be to say “Hi” or “Good Morning” or even be more formal and use the surname with appropriate salutation.

### Other Common Mistakes

Other common mistakes include calling from a foreign number, which is an almost guaranteed way of not being answered. If your prospect is in another country and indeed that country is a target market for you, then the best outcome is to obtain a local number from the country you’re calling to.

For the prospect it is also annoying to be called multiple times in a single day from the same number. While it actually might get the phone lifted eventually, it will not be because the person would want to hear your message.

Even more annoying for the prospect is to get called on the weekend or on a public holiday.

Finally, you need to be prepared so that if the call is answered you have a message that resonates with the prospect.

## Examples of Effective Phone Messaging

### Other tips for effective Phone Messaging

Whatever approach you take regarding business problems that Liferay can address there are some fundamental steps that will make phone messaging more effective

* **Allow your prospect to respond** \
Even when following a 2 minute long script, have short well thought sentences and questions as well as natural pauses between those sentences. Learning their needs will be impossible if the prospect isn’t given the opportunity to talk.
* **Smile** \
Even though there’s clearly no visual aspect to a phone call, the person at the other end hears if you are smiling and warm and empathetic. They also hear if you are insecure or even worse, bored.
