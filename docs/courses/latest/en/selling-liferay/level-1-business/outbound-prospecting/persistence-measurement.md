# Persistence & Measurement

## Persistence

The one tool that ties all of these others together is persistence, and this is perhaps the most disagreed upon tool of all. 

Despite what a lot of people consider to be the case, being _pleasantly_ persistent is proven to be an effective way of engaging with prospects.

> “Of the contacts that convert, 50% happen after the fifth touch.”

According to [Salesloft](https://pages.salesloft.com/rs/432-WAJ-793/images/33%20Tips%20for%20Optimizing%20B2B%20Sales%20Emails%20eBook.pdf?mkt_tok=NDMyLVdBSi03OTMAAAF9m1SHnRS1iDQqLvHu0D3bFwd2pc2WCy-UKAdmmWQOGz-6DViCCgC4OQKpG9r6aChNmAJ2IqiLavPIjflUUTytHTF-WqfNZgIe71uWadA&ref=blog.lavender.ai), “The optimal number of attempts to engage with a contact is 15.”  And according to [ZoomInfo](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/sales/sales-follow-up-statistics), “Of the contacts that convert, 50% happen after the fifth touch.”

In other words, as a seller, if the research on the account, the prospect, and on the use case, has been done, then there is no reason to be afraid or uncomfortable with being persistent. If you have something of value to share then you never need to apologize.

The key here is to do your research. Once you have this in place you can be confident that pleasant persistence will generate positive returns.

## Measure

The sixth and final tool is the ability to Measure. As the well known saying goes, “you can't improve what you don't measure.”

Coupled with this is the fact that in almost any sales role there are multiple tasks to be balanced:

* SDRs at Liferay are challenged with balancing Inbound tasks along with outbound tasks.
* AEs at Liferay are challenged with balancing closing deals along with finding new ones.
* CSMs at Liferay are challenged with balancing retaining clients along with growing those relationships.
* Sales People at Liferay partners might be doing all of the above or a combination of these, but most likely will be challenged by balancing various tasks as well.

Everyone is challenged to a degree with balancing competing tasks. And in the case of outbound prospecting it is important to understand how much time can be dedicated to outbound prospecting.

One way to determine this is to start with a goal, and then work backwards. In the scenario above the fictional goal is to produce 1 SQO, from outbound, per month, using some fairly conservative and realistic conversions to understand how many calls and emails need to be made on a monthly, weekly, and daily basis. 

As a result, as a seller, SDR, AE, CSM, juggling multiple priorities it is now possible to determine how much outbound prospecting needs to be done on a daily basis to achieve a specific target. 

At the end of each month by analyzing the performance achieved against these conversions it is possible to uncover where improvements need to be made. As a result of this outbound productivity tool, it is not only possible to understand how much time needs to be set aside for prospecting but also to measure how effective the prospecting is actually being, which in turn allows for improvement.

A dynamic version of the tool is available for download [here](https://learn.liferay.com/documents/d/guest/sdr-productivity-tool).

## The End Result

When email, phone, social, data, persistence, are used and measured properly, individually, and in synchronization, the end result is an effective outbound cadence.

![An effective outbound cadence can be created when email, phone, social, data, persistence, are used and measured properly, individually, and in synchronization.](./persistence-measurement/images/02.png)

To be effective in prospecting, use a cadence that has no less than 15 touches.

This cadence must include phone touches, email touches, and LinkedIn touches.

Not all prospects are created equally. Use a data enrichment tool to help prioritize which contacts deserve spending time on. Spend that time where there is the highest return on investment.

And lastly, measure the results of the prospecting cadence - because if it isn’t measured it can’t be improved.

Congratulations, that’s the end of the Outbound Prospecting module.
