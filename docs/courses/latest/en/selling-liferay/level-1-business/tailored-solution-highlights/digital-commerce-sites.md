# Digital Commerce sites

A Digital Commerce solution allows people or companies to buy physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet. These digital commerce sites might be Business to Business (B2B) solutions which allow business buyers to connect directly with manufacturers, distributors, and dealers to purchase goods and services.  They could also be Business to Consumer (B2C), where an end user is the person who is making the purchase. These solutions also include more advanced scenarios such as B2B2C or Government to Citizen (G2C).

## Digital Commerce

Liferay DXP contains native digital commerce functionalities that facilitate an experience-led digital buying journey for both B2B and B2C scenarios. Liferay allows companies to own the commerce experience, eliminating silos between customer acquisition and nurture. 

Liferay DXP is one platform that brings together content, products, and customer data, to offer better experiences at every touchpoint. Liferay has not acquired any digital commerce capabilities and later integrated it with Liferay DXP, but has innovated internally. This means that all the capabilities are part of a single architecture. Out-of-the-box, Liferay covers commerce, experience and automation, and integration capabilities. 

### Product Content Management

Liferay DXP provides OOTB functionalities to create and manage different types of products. Using the product content management (PCM) capabilities, organizations can enrich products by adding descriptions, specifications, images, fact sheets, etc. Other key features are Product Listing Pages (PLP), Product Detail Pages (PDP), up-sell, cross-sell, product comparison, wishlist, cart, checkout, search & browse, etc.

Zain is one of the leading telecommunication companies in the Middle East and Zain Kuwait is the group’s flagship operation.  This is a really good example of a complex B2C Digital Commerce Portal, and one of the first Liferay Digital Commerce use case implementations. Zain uses Liferay to provide an end-to-end buying journey and immersive customer experience. Currently there are more than 70,000 SKUs being managed for more than 3 million subscribers. 

Zain had a legacy system which was rigid and complex to customize. It also had a decentralized product catalog, along with complex processes to configure products and execute promotions. Zain used Liferay Catalog and Product Information Management capabilities to configure physical products such as smartphones, tablets, laptops etc., and virtual products such telecom plans, antivirus, google pay cards etc. Using Liferay’s price and promotion features Zain manages customer segment-specific pricing and creates discounts and promotions.

Liferay’s ML product recommendation capabilities are also being used by Zain. The entire order processing, shipment management, and inventory management has been implemented using Liferay.
