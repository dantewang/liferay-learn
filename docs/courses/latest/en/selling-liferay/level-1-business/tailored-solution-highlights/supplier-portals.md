# Supplier Portals

A Supplier Portal is a website that allows a company to connect and collaborate with suppliers of goods and services.  Supplier Portals are most commonly associated with manufacturers with complex supply chains. Any company in any industry will rely on suppliers to some degree and as they grow, their relationship with suppliers can become more difficult to manage and they may also benefit from a supplier portal.

## Key Liferay DXP Capabilities for Supplier Portals

Many challenges can be solved by implementing a Supplier Portal and not every opportunity is going to try and solve the same sets of challenges.  The following capabilities showcases Liferay DXP’s ability to be used as a supplier portal:

* [Segmentation & Personalization](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/site-building/personalizing-site-experience)
* [Identity Management & Access Control](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/installation-and-upgrades/securing-liferay)
* [Low-Code / No-Code Application Building](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/building-applications/objects)
* [Data Modeling & Process Automation](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/process-automation)
* [Commerce](https://learn.liferay.com/w/commerce/index)
* [Design Systems & Experience Management](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/site-building) 
* Integration & Interoperability
* [Search](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/using-search) & [Navigation](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/site-building/site-navigation)
* [Headless APIs & Multichannel](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/headless-delivery)
* [Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/collaboration-and-social)

When evaluating Liferay DXP’s ability to power a supplier portal, some of the most important capabilities to highlight will be:   

* Low-Code/No-Code App Building 
* Data Modeling & Process Management

## Low-Code/No-Code App Building

Liferay’s Low and No-Code capabilities empower business users to compose digital experiences. New low-code capabilities in Liferay DXP 7.4 make it easy to create powerful business applications, pages, and experiences that traditionally have required costly development.

With Liferay Objects, business applications can be built and delivered without having to write code or deploy modules. Each application built with Objects is integrated with Liferay’s core framework, so flexible solutions that adapt Liferay DXP to business needs can easily be implemented while maintaining a seamless user experience.

Forms can be designed for everything from business process automation to replacing complex paper applications. Personalized forms can be implemented by using conditional rules, which allows the form to adapt dynamically based on user input.

## Data Modeling & Process Management

Liferay provides a graphical workflow designer which can be used to define any number of simple to complex business processes or workflows. Workflows can be used organization-wide but can also be tailored for specific individual requirements.

Workflow Metrics provide insight into how long certain workflow events take to complete, with options to filter by Workflow Version. Additionally SLAs can be created to set deadlines on specific workflow events and activities.

## Case Study - Advanced Energy

Advanced Energy is a great example of a Supplier Portal that makes effective use of Data Modelling & Process Management as well as Low-Code/No-Code App Building. Founded in 1981, Advanced Energy is a global leader in reliable power conversion solutions used in thin-film plasma manufacturing processes and solar energy generation. Advanced Energy used Liferay to automate the supplier side of its processes with a self-service supplier portal for a very large and diverse set of suppliers.

As a global manufacturer of highly complex products that include thousands of components, Advanced Energy had no centralized system in place to collaborate with its suppliers. They relied on a silo approach to communicate in which each method was independent of one another. Fax, email, and phone communications were each used separately to assure crucial workflow information such as forecast and purchase order commitments were relayed back and forth.

Liferay’s Low and No-Code functionality was utilized to streamline the on-boarding process of the diverse set of suppliers, while Liferay’s workflow management tools were used to automate various internal complex processes.
