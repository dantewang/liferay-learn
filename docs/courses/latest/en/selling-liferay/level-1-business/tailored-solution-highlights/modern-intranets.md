# Modern Intranets

A modern intranet is a site that allows employees to share, collaborate, and communicate on one consistent platform.  Liferay DXP’s ability to integrate with and aggregate content and functionality from a wide variety of systems saves employees time by providing personalized experiences.

## Key Liferay DXP Capabilities for Modern Intranets

When discussing Liferay’s key capabilities for Modern Intranets, highlight Liferay’s portal heritage and ability to provide secure access to an integrated set of resources.  However, to stress the _modern_ nature of Liferay intranet solutions highlight some additional capabilities such as:

* [Design Systems & Experience Management](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/site-building) 
* [Content & Asset Management](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/content-authoring-and-management)
* [Low-Code / No-Code Application Building](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/building-applications/objects)
* [Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/collaboration-and-social)
* [Data Modeling & Process Automation](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/process-automation)
* [Segmentation & Personalization](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/site-building/personalizing-site-experience)
* [Search](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/using-search) & [Navigation](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/site-building/site-navigation)

With a particular focus on:  

* Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing
* Search & Navigation

## Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing

Collaboration in Liferay DXP is supported with applications for blogs, forums, message boards and other capabilities. Social networking features are also available to further support collaboration activities.

## Search & Navigation

A recent study found that the average employee spends 3.6 hours daily searching for information - which is an increase of one hour from the previous year’s report. IT employees spend half their day (4.2 hours) looking for relevant information. Sixty percent of employees have to search within four or more data sources every day, while 18% stumble between seven or more. 

All of this suggests that all emphasis should be on implementing a capable search functionality - however, another recent study observed that 70% of a technical audience actually used on-page navigation rather than search to find what they were looking for.

Liferay provides both powerful search capabilities as well as intuitive navigation building capabilities. Search features to be aware of are the ability to create synonym sets and providing business users with a way to manually adjust page ranking.

Liferay offers more advanced features such as Search Blueprints which can:

* Make minor tweaks to Liferay’s default search page behavior
* Override the search page behavior completely
* Configure context-aware search results based on attributes of the search user

![Search Blueprints is a feature that allows users to modify Liferay search behaviour without needing to write code.](./modern-intranets/images/02.png)

On the navigation front, Liferay provides powerful tools for creating and organizing pages. Everything from a simple, flat Site navigation to a complex hierarchical tree of sub-pages nested down many levels can be easily built.

By default, there is a defined page hierarchy to organize pages. In addition to this, separate Navigation Menus can be created to support one-off landing pages or even multiple navigation menus can be used: a main menu, secondary menus, footer menus, and custom menus.

Menus can differ by page: landing pages can show a simple list of frequently visited pages, and the rest can appear in secondary navigation.

## Case Study - Klabin

![The Klabin Case Study highlights the challenges and key objectives, describes the solution, and provides key success metrics.](./modern-intranets/images/03.png)

Klabin is the biggest producer and exporter of packaging paper in Brazil. With more than 23,000 direct employees, Klabin knew they needed a modern intranet solution able to harness the collective knowledge and experience of their diverse workforce.  Additionally, with 24 plants spread throughout Brazil and Argentina, Klabin needed a way to sustain the company’s culture digitally and to promote agile and organized communication for employees.  

Klabin selected Liferay Experience Cloud Self-Managed as the centerpiece of their modern intranet project not only for the lower TCO that a cloud based solution would provide, but also for the underlying DXP features that Liferay provides.  

Some of the key features were the collaboration capabilities that Liferay provides out of the box.  By providing users with the ability to share knowledge and access relevant content, they were able to launch a solution that not only led to greater productivity and strengthened organization culture but also earned more than a 95% user satisfaction rating.  

As already mentioned, the user base for this solution was very diverse with jobs  ranging from skilled technical labor to business functions.  With so many different types of users, it was critical that the solution be as user-friendly as possible, to reduce the need for detailed training.  It was important to cater to the needs and preferences of a variety of users and devices and to offer up powerful search and intuitive navigation capabilities. Search and navigation won’t replace the need for training and onboarding, but they can definitely help to increase user adoption and the Klabin solution has already been adopted by over 90% of the employees.
