## Battlecard Summaries

The session on [Competitive Landscape and Liferay Positioning](../../level-0/competitive-landscape-and-liferay-positioning.md) covered the four categories that Liferay's competitors are grouped into: Low Code Application Platforms (LCAP), Composable Point Solutions (CPS), Digital Experience Platforms (DXP), and Enterprise Suites.

This section contains a brief review of each of the currently available Battlecards. This is _not_ intended to be a deep-dive, please download the Battlecards themselves to view all of the details.

### Acquia

* Acquia is a SaaS company that provides enterprise products, services, and technical support for the open-source web content management platform Drupal.
* Acquia's main focus and strength are in CMS and B2C website solution use cases.
* Liferay continues to be stronger in B2B and B2E Experience use cases, according to the latest report from Gartner.

### Adobe Experience Cloud

* Adobe Experience Cloud is a collection of integrated online marketing and web analytics products by Adobe Inc.
* Liferay offers a substantially lower total cost of ownership (TCO).
* For complex scenarios requiring extensive integration with other systems, including legacy, internal and back-office systems, Liferay outperforms Adobe.

### Optimizely

* Optimizely provides a SaaS DXP and is strong in B2C use cases.
* Episerver acquired Optimizely in 2021, and chose Optimizely as the rebranded name for both companies.

### Sitecore

* Sitecore is a DXP focused on marketing driven opportunities.
* Customers report limited out-of-the-box capabilities that require a lot of customization and hidden costs, as well as a lack of direct support to all customers.
* Personalization with Liferay extends beyond targeting content (Sitecore is primarily a CMS) and includes all engagements, interactions, and transactions not based on a content interaction.

### HCL Technologies

* HCL Technologies is a multinational IT services and consulting company that offers HCL Digital Experience.
* IBM sold a number of the Websphere software products to HCL in 2019.
* Liferay is the clear alternative for organizations that currently have IBM Websphere Portal and are experiencing the pain of rising costs, potential disruption in support and the possibility of discontinued future development.
* Liferay can make the transition easy, providing organizations with a modern, reliable, secure, manageable and affordable infrastructure now and in the future, with the flexibility and customizability of Java-based open source code, out of the box applications, and Headless APIs.

### Magnolia

* Magnolia is a Java-based, open-source CMS.
* Magnolia is primarily a CMS, not a true digital experience platform like Liferay.

### Open Source Drupal

* Another open source competitor is Drupal and more specifically Open Source Drupal is a “free” CMS written in PHP. Acquia DXP is based on Drupal.
* Emphasize the hybrid nature of Liferay's headless implementation which is a distinguishing feature from other CMS vendors. It is unique in that you can create content in the UI, create it via Headless or both.
* Liferay recently won an opportunity with a organization that was also considering Drupal. The customer ultimately chose Liferay because they determined that Liferay is an extensively used product, and the Liferay partner ecosystem backing the technology also transmitted confidence.

### Salesforce

* Salesforce Experience Cloud is a set of functionality acquired by and built on top of the Salesforce CRM platform, which allows companies to build digital experiences.
* Liferay recently won an opportunity with a manufacturing organization that was also considering Salesforce. Liferay stood out from the other competitors with the service level experience (sales team, responsiveness, availability, etc.), which was one of the deciding factors which led to Liferay winning the opportunity.
* Another recent win was with a telecommunications company. The two main differentiators were cost and integration capabilities. Salesforce was going to cost much more, and the customer felt that Liferay was superior in its breadth of integration capabilities. They wanted a single platform to give access to their different enterprise systems, which made integration key.

### Sharepoint

* Microsoft Sharepoint is a collaboration platform designed for the purpose of storing and managing documents and content. 
* There are no B2B capabilities and Sharepoint runs on Microsoft environments only, leading to vendor lock-in.
* Liferay has one of the highest scores for B2B Experience use cases (according to the latest Gartner report), has more flexible deployment options, and can be integrated with third party applications without risk of vendor lock-in.

### Wordpress VIP

* Wordpress VIP is an agile content platform for the enterprise ecosystem.
* The Enterprise version of Wordpress lacks many of the advanced capabilities required of a DXP, even though it is positioned by Wordpress as a DXP.

### Oracle Service Cloud

* Oracle has created an Enterprise Application suite by acquiring 65 companies, integrated to create "Fusion Applications".
* Oracle's main focus is to cover end-to-end business processes, with a focus on ERP, with very little focus on CX, or Digital Experience.
* Oracle is no longer regarded as a DXP player according to Gartner.
* Liferay usually only competes with Oracle when an organization already has a big Oracle footprint, where Oracle already has vendor lock-in.

### OutSystems

* OutSystems is a Low-Code development platform.
* Liferay has Low-Code / No-Code capabilities, but OutSystems themselves lack true digital experience platform capabilities and are not necessarily a direct competitor.
* This battlecard is taking the concept of a _pure_ low-code or no-code solution, and why we think that using a product like Liferay with low-code/no-code capabilities, but much more to offer in addition, could be a better solution to an organization’s problem.

### Low-Code / No-Code

This Battlecard summarizes some selling points against any Low-Code / No-Code software.

* The low-code/no-code modular approach lets developers quickly build applications by relieving them of the need to write code line by line. 
* It is important to remember that a DXP like Liferay with strong low-code / no-code capabilities is a much stronger proposition than a pure low-code / no code solution.
* The use of Low-Code/No-Code platforms has increased in order to support the digital transformation processes. 
* Low-Code development requires users to do some level of coding, albeit much less than is required with traditional application development. 
* No-Code development targets nontechnical users in various business functions who understand business needs and rules, but possess little or no coding experience and programming language skills. 
* Liferay is not a Low-Code Platform, it is a true DXP with Low Code capabilities.
* Liferay is investing heavily into adding Low-Code / No-Code capabilities like Objects.
* When competing against a pure-play Low-Code / No-Code platform avoid direct comparisons as they will not be like-for-like.

### MACH Alliance

* MACH Alliance is not a competitor, but it is an umbrella organization for technologies that are:
  * Microservices based
  * API first
  * Cloud native
  * Headless
* Liferay can accommodate these needs and aspirations well, but the full DXP offers much greater value than a pure MACH stack.
* MACH advocates that companies should be able to pick and choose the top solutions from top vendors to build an incredible stack.
* Liferay is well aligned with MACH philosophy and features of a MACH platform, and provides many of the features and benefits of MACH, but Liferay advocates the use of one platform. A key point is that a MACH stack will require a UI to be developed from scratch, while Liferay provides a rich UI that can be extended easily with many of the same benefits.

### SAP Hybris

* SAP Hybris is an e-commerce platform with origins in product management and master data management. 
* Liferay's portal capabilities well exceed those of SAP Hybris. 
* SAP integrates well with _other_ SAP products, but it is difficult to integrate with other systems.  Since very few companies use SAP exclusively this can create significant challenges.

### Bloomreach

* Bloomreach looks to serve digital commerce and marketing professionals seeking to transform the way they manage commerce experiences across all touchpoints.
* Bloomreach is _mainly_ focused on digital commerce oriented use cases for B2C and B2B markets
* Bloomreach recently rebranded itself and goes to market as a “commerce experience platform.” 
* Caution may be required when customers try to use Bloomreach in non-transactional scenarios.

### ShopifyPlus

* ShopifyPlus is a user-friendly and scalable enterprise e-commerce platform for high volume merchants
* ShopifyPlus has evolved from the consumer-focused Shopify application
* Shopify is a best fit for digital businesses that need a quick, light, and usable solution
* ShopifyPlus has significant functional limitations compared with true enterprise platforms

### Backbase

* Backbase is a fast growing fintech software provider that empowers financial institutions to accelerate their digital transformation and compete in a digital-first world.
* Despit being a best fit for digital businesses that need certain limited use cases, Backbase has significant functional limitations versus its enterprise peers.

### Contentful

* Contentful is a flexible and future-friendly content platform that helps editors to manage and developers to serve content into mobile or web applications.
* Despite being one of the fastest growing brands in the market, Contentful has certain limitations for sites that require high levels of customization, especially e-commerce.

### Umbraco

* Umbraco is an open-source .NET Core CMS. 
* Umbraco is used by more than 500,000 companies and web solutions around the world, from small business brochure sites to complex multilingual corporate websites.
* Although Umbraco may be a good fit for a project consisting of a single website, it seems to be costly and lacking in features and accessibility that are needed for more complex solutions.
