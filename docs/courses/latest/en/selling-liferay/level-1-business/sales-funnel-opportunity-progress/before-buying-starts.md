# Before the Buying Starts

**At a Glance**

* The buying process can be Seller or Buyer initiated
* Buyer initiated processes have two flavors:
  * With a “second” buyer
  * Without a “preferred” vendor
* Seller initiated processes have no budget allocated, or requirements defined
* Buyer initiated processes where there is a preferred vendor typically have requirements defined by that vendor and introduce more risk than where there is no preferred vendor 

## What Happens Before the Buying Starts?

In the prospecting 101 module “true prospecting” was described as “making somebody who had not yet recognized a need and decided to start fulfilling a need to actually consider doing something and starting a buying process”. 

If this is how the buying starts, there is no budget allocated yet. The buyer's need is a latent need. It was also highlighted how important it is to be speaking with a relevant contact who is high-level enough at the buyer organization. 

The buying process could start in 3 different ways:

* Seller initiated
* Buyer initiated, with a “second” vendor
* Buyer initiated, without a “Preferred” vendor

### Seller Initiated

The seller initiates the buying cycle through an outbound approach aiming to take the prospect from latent to active need. 

The person contacted doesn’t have clear requirements and the conversation is, and should be, more business than offering focused. If the discussion, or several of these discussions, go well there’s a high likelihood of becoming a so-called preferred vendor. 

The seller has a chance to impact and emphasize areas where they are stronger than some competitors. Their chances of winning the business eventually are good but the process might take longer. 

### Buyer Initiated, with a “Second” Vendor

The prospect contacts a vendor (i.e. an inbound approach) but they already have a so-called preferred vendor in the process too. 

This other vendor probably started the process much earlier through the seller initiated approach described above. Everyone else invited by the buyer are so-called “second vendors”. The contact person reaching out to these second vendors is certainly not C-level, most likely not Director level either, and they are not the decision maker. The biggest mistake by sellers in these types of buyer-initiated buying processes is that they stay with this initial contact person because it is easier than trying to find a more appropriate contact.

The discussions will be more offering-focused, but unless the seller can make an impact on the requirements and gain access to all key buying influencers and decision makers the chances of winning at the end are not very high. 

In these cases the requirements list was probably compiled by the preferred vendor and the prospect together. When an unexpected RFP or RFQ is received, this is most likely the case. 

When the vendor is presented with strict schedules and a demand to share their prices at an early stage, particularly when the buyer does not really share the business needs, it is worth considering just walking away.

### Buyer Initiated, without a “Preferred” Vendor

The prospect contacts several vendors after doing their own research via internet, social, forums, networks. The requirements list is a combination of their current system’s best parts and everything else they found important when doing the research. 

These requirements are not tailored to a particular vendor so the company that can best align with these requirements coupled with the work done by the buyer and helping the buyer to set milestones and maybe define some business goals and demonstrate and prove value for all key players will most likely walk out as a winner.
