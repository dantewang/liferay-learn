## The Purpose of (Outbound) Prospecting

At a high level outbound prospecting does the following:

1. Introduces prospects into the sales cycle with the goal of ultimately converting them to customers
2. Increases brand awareness and consideration
3. Outbound prospecting supports inbound marketing through:
  1. Increasing organic traffic to the company website
  2. Outbound contacts can be used for ad retargeting
  3. Helps to define the ideal customer profile (ICP)
  4. Improves go-to-market messaging

### Why do we do prospecting?

According to a recent study performed by [Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/effective-sales-prospecting-techniques-you-should-be-using#:~:text=Prospecting%20isn%27t%20easy%20%E2%80%94%20more,conversations%20and%20better%20win%20rates), over 40% of salespeople find prospecting to be the most challenging part of the sales process, so it begs the obvious question, “Why do we do it?”

It is important to emphasize that hard does not mean impossible. Outbound is used by almost every SaaS and technology company to introduce prospects into the sales cycle and convert them into paying customers.

When outbound prospecting is done professionally with quality it is an important tool to increase brand awareness in a positive way. This leads to more marketing lead generation. Outbound supports inbound marketing and vice versa. 

Even if a prospect would not say yes immediately, it is likely that some of these prospects end up browsing the Liferay website and in doing so increase organic traffic. Also, some prospects that are deemed not-so-hot can be added to various marketing driven retargeting campaigns.

When prospecting is done really well, it succeeds in turning potential and ideal prospective customers who were not looking for a Liferay offering into relevant contacts who might in the future consider Liferay’s offerings.

That is true prospecting and that is why it is hard. 

It is important to note that budget will not have been allocated if the potential customer was not looking for an offering initially. In these cases initial approaches will need to be to senior individuals who can command budgets. In the case of Liferay offerings - depending on the market and also the size of the prospect company or organization - it is usually a Director or C-Level executive who owns access to funds.  

Additionally, in many enterprises in particular, buying requires a large group of people to agree. It makes sense to start approaching several different individuals right from the start while remembering that the approach and message needs to resonate with the role.
