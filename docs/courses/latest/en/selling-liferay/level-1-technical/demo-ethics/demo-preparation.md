# Demo Ethics - Demo Preparation

**At a Glance**

* Demos are a vital part of the sales process, and all Sales Engineers should be prepared to deliver demos to prospects.
* To be effective at delivering demos Sales Engineers need to understand the audience, choose the right demo, tailor the demo for each prospect, know the demo well, and expect the unexpected.
* Additional hints and tips can help prepare Sales Engineers further to be more effective at delivering demos.

## Preparing to Deliver a Demo

Some key considerations when preparing for a demo are:

* Know the audience
* Select the best fit demo
* Tailor that demo to best fit the prospect
* Know the demo
* Expect the unexpected
* Expect things to break

## Know the Audience

It is important to know who is attending the demo, and have the demo tailored for their needs. Making sure that everyone introduces themselves is critical because it is very common for people to come along unexpectedly, and if possible the needs of these people should be catered for as well.

## Select and Tailor the Best Fit Demo

Make sure that the selected demo aligns well with the needs of the prospect, and use some simple tricks such as the ones covered in the earlier modules to tailor the demo to fit the prospect.

## Know the Demo

It is really important to know the demo inside and out. This is not just the flow that the script uses, but everything else too. A demo is not a finished application, just because there is a navigation menu with dozens of pages on it doesn’t mean that those pages are complete.

If the script, or the individual situation, calls for showing how something was built, pick a part of the demo that is suitable for that and learn it really well.

## Expect the Unexpected

Coupled with knowing the demo well is expecting the unexpected, as much as seeing into the future is possible at least! Sometimes, someone will ask to see something that has not been asked for before. Sometimes that particular feature might not be in the demo being shown, but might be in a different demo.

It is important to be ready to jump around a bit if asked, but only if asked because there is no point jumping from one demo to another if it is not needed. Showing something from a live Liferay site is OK too, for example if the prospect is looking for a public website, it’s perfectly acceptable to show a live Liferay public website.

If the prospect asks about, say, Blogs, then Liferay.com can be used, or liferay.dev if the audience is more technical. But, have those things in mind in advance, try not to start digging around trying to find something without a really clear view of where it is beforehand.

## Expect Things to Break

In any demo something might break, and probably will. Even the same thing that worked a thousand times before might break the next time round. Don’t get too hung up on it, if it is a simple fix, fix it there and then, but don’t go into a full troubleshooting session. Just quickly move on, and make a joke about doing live demos or something like that!

## Summary and Demo Hints & Tips

* Don’t show everything that is available in the demo - focus on what matters to the audience - and adapt along the way.
* Really really really know how the demo works and expect to be asked to go “off-road” and deviate from the planned script.
* But, when going off-road make sure to know the audience - a marketing user (probably) won’t want to see code, even if it is just the source for a fragment, or a web content template.
* Even when tweaking an existing demo, and definitely when building a demo from scratch, try not to agonize over every tiny thing. If the main menu does not work exactly like the one on the prospect’s website, or with exactly the same font, chances are they won’t even notice. Before realizing this important fact most Sales Engineers have spent many hours building some feature, trying to make something do exactly what they wanted, and then in the actual demo it was gone in a couple of seconds, or maybe wasn’t even shown at all.
* Whatever is shown, make sure it is in context - that it resonates with the prospect, that they are being shown something that they can relate to.
* Simple tricks really do bear fruit. Change the site logo to the prospect’s company logo, switch some colors, because the more the prospect feels like they are seeing _their_ application the more they will begin to think of Liferay being used in their organization.
* With content, don’t use the “lorum ipsum” pseudo-text. That is designed for and is OK for showing how content will fill available space, but it makes a demo look like a mockup. Obviously a demo is not a finished solution, but having content that is in line with the prospect’s industry, having images that would be relevant for their use cases, all aids with getting them engaged with the demo, and seeing their application solved using Liferay.
* Gain trust because it offers latitude. What this means is that it is not necessary for everything to be “pixel perfect”. If part of the demo uses the prospect’s branding, but then another element is shown using the OOTB styling, that is OK. Showing part of the requirements using the prospect’s branding proves that a Liferay solution can look like one of their applications, which gives the latitude to show other things that are in other demos, or online somewhere, that _don’t_ use their branding.
* Make sure the entire sales team is aligned. Doing a demo in the first meeting can cause more harm than good. If the Sales Engineer has explained this to the AE but they still set up the initial meeting and called it a “Liferay Demo” session, the SE will find themselves in an awkward position. This can happen, and even if it does, it is still OK to explain to the prospect that they are not going to actually see a demo - and why it would be wasting their time, but it is much better that the sales team is aligned upfront and the AE set the session up as “Liferay Introduction” rather than a demo.
