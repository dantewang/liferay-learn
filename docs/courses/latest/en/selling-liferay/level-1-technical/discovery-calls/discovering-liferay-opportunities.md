# Discovery Calls - Liferay Opportunities

**At a Glance**

* Discovery Calls are used to
  * Qualify and perform basic discovery
  * Discover what might be needed to be shown in a subsequent demo
* Sales Engineers should be involved in both phases
* Technical qualification in discover calls relates to
  * Liferay’s position in the overall architecture
  * Technical Stack preferences
  * Fit in the overall solution architecture

## Discovering Liferay Opportunities

The first part of any discovery process is essentially trying to determine what the prospect’s underlying requirements are, and this is clearly constrained by what the prospect is prepared to share.

This part of discovery is always a team effort with the rest of the sales team, where the different parts of the team are getting a full understanding of the vertical that the customer operates in, what the budgetary constraints are, what the buying process is, and where the prospect is up to in that process.  

There’s also a background element that is already understood by the sales team - for example is this an opportunity with a completely new prospect, or a new project for an existing customer.

This base discovery is not the responsibility of the Sales Engineer, but it is important that the Sales Engineer is involved because of the context that this provides to any demo preparation. 

When the Sales Engineer is engaged, their role is to advise on the technical possibilities of the solution, and to understand whether the problem that the customer has can be solved technically with Liferay.

This technical qualification is therefore based around the expectations the customer has in respect of Liferay, and there are three key considerations that are needed to determine whether there is a good fit for Liferay in the opportunity or not:

* Understanding the positioning of Liferay in the overall architecture
* Understanding the preference for Technical Stack
* Expectations of Liferay in the overall solution architecture

### Positioning Liferay in the Architecture

When talking about positioning Liferay in the architecture, the key thing to understand is whether Liferay is at the center of the architecture or something that is integrated into an existing architecture.

Understanding the positioning is the most important aspect of qualifying Liferay from the technical perspective, because it helps to explain the prospect’s expectations for Liferay in the project. The following are the main ways that Liferay is typically positioned technically within a customer’s architecture:

* Liferay as the core platform
* Liferay as an integration platform
* Liferay as an add-on to existing architecture (Liferay as a plugin)
* Liferay as an experience manager
* Liferay as a commerce platform 
* Liferay as a Digital Asset Manager
* etc.

Knowing where Liferay is expected to fit helps to frame the way that a later demo will be given. For example, if Liferay is to be used as the core platform, then the demo can focus on the broader platform capabilities, without necessarily talking about a particular solution - although of course, if the solution use-case is known as well (which it should be!) then the demo should be aligned to this solution.

Another thing that is really important on these early calls is not to get drawn into providing or designing the solution.  The main purpose is to learn as much about the requirements as possible. It is about listening and understanding during the discovery calls.

The first key distinction is whether Liferay is going to be used as the core platform, or as more of an integration platform, and so on. If the need is to be used as an add-on to an existing architecture then the prospect is likely going to be looking for a very specific feature to complete whatever is currently missing in their ecosystem.

As an example, the prospect might indicate that they have their content management needs covered, and that their experience platform is working, but that they are lacking capabilities of digital asset management, along with some integration capabilities. In this case the need is for Liferay to supply these capabilities.  Knowing this helps define the demo, and ensures that when the demo is delivered it goes well, because it can focus on exactly what is missing.

In many ways this list can be used as a checklist, along with the notes that are taken along the way, to help create or form the basis for an upcoming demo.

These then are the basic questions that help to determine whether Liferay is a technical fit for the prospect or not. And even if some of the information is known up front, there’s nothing wrong in confirming or asking more about the details. The answers gathered here should also be shared with the rest of the sales team, because, at a high level at least, the implementation timelines for each different type of solution are different, and so can help to inform the business side of the sales team what the sales cycle might look like.

In summary for this section, the information gathered is useful internally, and it also helps explain to the prospect whether Liferay is the best fit solution for them or not, and starts to show how Liferay can solve their problem.

### Preference for Technical Stack

While for some products, a preference for one technical stack or another may not be that important, for Liferay sales opportunities it is one of the most important questions to ask. In many cases a prospect may not have a specific preference, but even if they initially indicate that they do not, there’s still a need to dig deeper.

For example, they might indicate that they don’t really have a preference, but then you discover that their current environment is completely a .net stack, and there’s an expectation that Liferay is to be integrated into that stack. This can often be considered a red, or at least an orange flag, because it might lead to a preference for a .net-based DXP, so understanding this fact will require exploring further what the real preferences are. 

Or the prospect might have SAP in their stack and expect Liferay to be integrated with SAP and work well in this ecosystem. Learning this fact early in the sales process provides time to gather information to talk about not just how Liferay can integrate with SAP, but to research customer success stories to back up the integration specifics.

Often this sort of detail can get missed during discovery, and if it is missed, then it becomes much harder to talk convincingly, or to provide those success stories, at a later stage, during a demo, and so on. Much of what is done during a demo, or a technical sales discussion, is about building confidence that Liferay can actually do what the marketing says it can, and these sorts of Customer proof points are vital.

### Liferay in the overall Solution Architecture

In almost all Liferay implementations, Liferay is not the only technology that the customer is using. Options here are:

* Liferay will be integrated into the solution architecture.
* Liferay will be the center of the architecture, with other technologies and tools integrated into it.

These are substantially different scenarios, which is why it is very important to understand the overall ecosystem because it is much better to be prepared by understanding the way that Liferay is to be used within their architecture than it is to be caught out at a later stage. The objective is to get prospects to share the goal for the overall solution and the other technologies being used.
