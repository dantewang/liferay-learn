# Discovery Calls

**At a Glance**

* Discovery Calls are used to
  * Qualify and perform basic discovery
  * Discover what might be needed to be shown in a subsequent demo
* Sales Engineers should be involved in both phases
* Technical qualification in discovery calls relates to Liferay’s position in the overall architecture, technical stack preferences and fit in the overall solution architecture
* Demo discovery focuses on understanding the Audience, Personas, Requirements, UX & User Journey mapping, Technology Stack, Current System, and Sizing

## Background

All of the work needed to be done to be able to present a Liferay demo starts with a Discovery Call.

When talking about discovery calls, the most common purpose is to discover and qualify opportunities in general. In this context it does not _necessarily_ mean discovering new opportunities or qualifying an opportunity - but of course it can and will be much of the time.  Another important output of a discovery call is to collect the requirements needed to be ready to demo to the prospect.

This module is designed to help you understand what you must gain from a discovery call so that you can deliver a meaningful demo. At the same time, the information gathered can and should be shared with the rest of the sales team to help to qualify the opportunity.

Most of the time in a technical sales role, whether that’s a Sales Engineer, a Pre-Sales Consultant, or often for Partners an Implementation Consultant being used in the sales process, the initial qualification will have been done prior to the Sales Engineer being involved.

The initial qualification might have been done by a BDR, an SDR, an Account Executive, and so on. It is important however that the Sales Engineer is involved relatively early in the process, and in particular Sales Engineers should be brought to be the major part of the initial _technical_ qualification process.

Discovering an opportunity is just the start of the sales engineering process.

The module is divided into two main parts, reflecting the different phases of discovery:

1. Discovering an opportunity
2. Discovering demo requirements
