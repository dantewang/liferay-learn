Welcome to the Level 1 Selling Liferay learning path for Business Sales Roles! Level 1 expands on the foundations provided by [Level 0](./level-0.md) to provide Liferay sellers with additional skills they need to be successful when generating prospects for Liferay through to closing deals and working with Liferay’s contracts.

## Expected Outcomes

* Know how to create a healthy pipeline of Liferay opportunities
* Learn how to effectively have a sales conversation with a prospective customer, and inspire them to share needs and be able to prove value
* To be able to showcase the possibilities and ROI to drive an opportunity from qualification to close

## Roles

This learning path is for all business sales roles including, but not limited to

* Account Executives (AEs)
* Business Development Representatives (BDRs)
