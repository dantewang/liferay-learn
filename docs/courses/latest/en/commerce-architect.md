# Commerce Architect

Liferay's full-fledged Commerce offering comes with a host of product management, order management, inventory management, and pricing capabilities. We'll continue the fictional story of Delectable Bonsai as they plan to sell a wide range of products to their regular customers and other businesses. They have a publicly accessible online shop that caters to regular customers and a B2B online store.

After setting up your users, accounts and organizations from the Liferay Administrator course and the necessary content from the Liferay Site Designer course, you’re all set to build and customize the two online stores. By the end of this course, you’ll learn, 

* To set up multiple product catalogs to cater to different storefronts
* To create multiple channels based on the type of store they’re connected to
* To create products, configure them, and add useful metadata like specifications, media, and attachments
* To set up warehouses and configure them
* To set up buyer and seller workflows
* How to use the out-of-the-box widgets and fragments to create beautiful storefronts
* How order splitting helps in order fulfillment with multiple suppliers
* How order types help to differentiate between different types of orders and further customize them
* How to set up terms and conditions for different payment methods and shipping options
