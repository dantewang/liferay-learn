# Commerce Architect

Liferay’s full-fledged Commerce offering comes with a host of product management, order management, inventory management, and pricing capabilities. This course continues the story of Clarity as they plan to sell their products to both regular customers and other businesses. They plan to offer a publicly accessible shop for direct-to-consumer sales and a storefront for businesses that requires a log-in.

* To create and configure multiple channels on a single Liferay instance
* To set up shipping charges
* To create products, configure them, and add useful information like specifications, media, and attachments
* To set up warehouses and configure them
* To set up buyer and seller workflows and notifications
* How to use the out-of-the-box widgets and fragments to create beautiful storefronts
* How to use an object action to split orders fulfilled by multiple suppliers
* To set up discounts, promotions, and price lists
* How order types help to differentiate between different types of orders and further customize them
