# Relating Object Entries

After defining an object relationship, you can relate entries in two ways: the Liferay UI or relationship REST APIs. Here you'll practice using both methods to relate evaluations and applications.

## Creating Sample Entries

1. Download and unzip the resources for [this exercise](./liferay-g2n9.zip):

   ```bash
   curl https://learn.liferay.com/courses/latest/en/application-development/modeling-data-structures/defining-relationships/relating-object-entries/liferay-g2n9.zip -O
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip liferay-g2n9.zip
   ```

   This includes two scripts for creating _ and __ entries.

1. Navigate to the `curl` folder in the `liferay-g2n9` folder:

   ```bash
   cd liferay-g2n9/curl
   ```

1. Run this command to create three entries for the Distributor Application object:

   ```bash
   
   ```

1. Verify the entries appear in the Distributor Application application page:

   ```bash
   
   ```

1. Create three entries for the Application Evaluation object:

   ```bash
   
   ```

1. Verify the entries appear in the Application Evaluation application page:

   ```bash
   
   ```

## Using the Layouts to Relate Entries

Congratulations! You have successfully modeled the necessary data structures for Delectable Bonsai's distributor onboarding flow. Now you can start incorporating the business logic necessary for bringing your application to life, such as workflows, validations, notifications. You'll do this in our next module.
