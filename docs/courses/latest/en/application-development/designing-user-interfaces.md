# Designing User Interfaces

Your application must have a user interface. Liferay gives you the tools to create dynamic and responsive UIs integrated with the platform <!--ALT: sites-->, so users have a consistent user experience to access application data and features in your site.

So far, Delectable Bonsai's application uses object layouts and views. While these are serviceable for administrative users, they have limited customization options, and only users with access to the Global Menu ![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png) can see them. Since Delectable Bonsai wants anyone to be able to apply, object layouts and views do not satisfy their requirements.

<!-- Transition -->

For the Distributor Application, Delectable Bonsai needs these UIs in their site:

* An Apply page for submitting applications
* A Success page for submissions
* An Application Overview page for managing and editing applications
* A display page for viewing each application's details

<!-- Put screenshots of the four pages here. They can be reduced so you have four pages in four quadrants. -Rich --> 

The first step is adding pages to the site.
