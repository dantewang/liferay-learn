# Designing User Interfaces

Designing user interfaces for applications is integral to creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. Using Liferay's page builder features, you can create dynamic and responsive UIs integrated with the platform <!--ALT: sites-->, providing a consistent user experience and access to application data and features in your site.

So far, Delectable Bonsai's application uses object layouts and views. While these are serviceable for administrative users, they have limited customization options and are only accessible to users who can access the Global Menu ![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png). Since Delectable Bonsai wants to make applications accessible in their site, object layouts and views do not satisfy their requirements.

<!-- Transition -->

For the Distributor Application, Delectable Bonsai needs these UIs in their site:

* An apply page for submitting applications
* A success page for submissions
* An application overview page for managing and editing applications
* A display page for viewing each application's details

The first step is adding pages to the site.
