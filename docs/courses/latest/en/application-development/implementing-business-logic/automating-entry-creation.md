# Automating Entry Creation

Coming Soon!

<!-- 
## Action for Creating Evaluations

Create a standalone action for creating evaluations that are automatically related to the current application. Also populate the Business Name field for the evaluation using the related object. These fields should be readonly after entry creation.

## Action for Creating Accounts

If `applicationState == "approved" AND status == "approved"`, then it should automatically create an account using the Business Name Field, also the applicant and primary contact should be invited to the account.
