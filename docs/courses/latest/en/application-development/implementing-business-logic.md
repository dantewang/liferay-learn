# Implementing Business Logic

Business logic refers to the rules and processes that determine how an application behaves within a system to meet business needs. Implementing business logic effectively can streamline operations, improve efficiency, and promote consistency across your organization.

Examples include,

* Validating Fields

* Managing Data Access

* Defining Workflows

* Automating Notifications

<!-- Other example: Integrating with External Systems, Calculations, Data Transformation, Localization, Logging -->

Having modeled the Distributor Application object, you can incorporate these additional functionalities to make it more flexible/adaptable/scalable<!--w/c--> and ensure it fulfills Delectable Bonsai's business requirements.

<!-- Transition... "Once implemented, Delectable Bonsai can onboard distributors quickly and safely."-->
