# Modeling Data Structures

Modeling data structures for custom solutions involves three main stages/parts<!--w/c-->:

1. Identifying the types of data you want to store and manipulate

1. Defining attributes for each type of data entity

1. Defining relationships between data entities

For example, a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution may include multiple types of data entities for accounts, opportunities, issues, campaigns, and more. Each entity would have its own data fields and relationships with other entities to help integrate data and facilitate customer service.
