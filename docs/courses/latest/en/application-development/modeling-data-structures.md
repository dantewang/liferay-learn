# Modeling Data Structures

Your first step in writing an application is to model its data structures. This requires some brainstorming about the application you want to write: 

* Identifying the types of data entities you want to store and manipulate

* Adding attributes to each data entity

* Defining relationships between data entities

<!-- For example, a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution may include multiple types of data entities, such as Accounts, Opportunities, Campaigns, and Issues. Each entity would have its own database table with fields for storing different types of values. They could also have relationships between each entity to help integrate data and facilitate customer service.-->
