# Modeling Data Structures

Modeling data structures for custom solutions involves three main stages/parts<!--w/c-->:

1. Defining/Identifying<!--w/c--> the types of data entities you want to store and manipulate

1. Defining attributes for each type of data entity

1. Defining relationships between data entities

<!-- Diagram? -->

For example, a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution may include multiple types of data entities, such as Accounts, Opportunities, Campaigns, and Issues. Each entity would have its own database table with fields for storing different types of values. It could also include relationships between each entity to help integrate data and facilitate customer service.

Once defined, you can start incorporating the business logic/functionality<!--w/c--> necessary for bringing your application to life (e.g., workflows, validations, notifications).
