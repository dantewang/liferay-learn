* Identifying the types of data entities you want to store and manipulate

* Adding attributes to each data entity

* Defining relationships between data entities

<!-- For example, a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution may include multiple types of data entities, such as Accounts, Opportunities, Campaigns, and Issues. Each entity would have its own database table with fields for storing different types of values.
