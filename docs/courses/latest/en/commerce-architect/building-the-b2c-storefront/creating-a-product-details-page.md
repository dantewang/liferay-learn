# Creating a Product Details Page

The product details page displays all the information about a selected product. So far, weâ€™ve added a featured products grid and also a catalog page, but you cannot select any of these products to view more details about them. 

## Creating a New Page

1. Open the *Product Menu* (![Product Menu](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)), and navigate to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

1. Click *Add* (![Add](../../images/icon-plus.png)) next to the shop page, to add a child page, and click *Add Page*.

1. Select the master page template.

1. Enter the name as *Product Details* and click *Add*. This opens the new page in edit mode.

## Applying the CSS Client Extension

You must now configure the created page in Liferay to use your deployed client extension:

1. Open the product details page, click on *Edit* (![Edit](../../images/icon-edit.png)) at the top.

1. In the sidebar, navigate to the *Page Design Options* menu (![Page Design Options icon](../../images/icon-format.png)) and click the *Configuration* (![Configuration](../../images/icon-format.png)) icon at the top of the menu.

1. In the CSS Client Extensions section toward the bottom of the page, click *Add CSS Client Extensions*.

1. Select your CSS client extension from the pop-up modal and click *Add*.

1. Click *Save*.

## Customizing the Product Details Page

1. Drag and drop a container on the page. Change the *Container Width* to *Fixed Width*.

1. In the *Advanced* section, give it the CSS class `p-3`.

1. Drag and drop the *Product Details* widget inside the fixed width container.

1. Drag and drop a *Heading* fragment and a *Separator* fragment below the *Product Details* widget

1. Set the header title to *Related Products*.

1. Set the *Heading Level* to *H3*.

1. In the *Advanced* section of the header fragment, add the `text-center`, `mb-1`, and `mt-5` CSS classes. 

1. Click on the separator and go to the *Advanced* section. Add the `section-text-line` and `mb-5` CSS classes.

1. Drag and drop the *Product Publisher* widget inside the fixed width container.

1. Click on the *Actions* (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) icon to customize the widget.

1. Under *Product Selection*, select *Data Source*.

1. From the *Data Source* dropdown, select *Product Relations related*.
