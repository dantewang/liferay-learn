# Creating and Configuring Catalogs

Clarity caters to businesses and consumers and has a wide range of products. Damian, the category manager, must create a catalog to store these products. Some products are fulfilled by third-party suppliers, and they’ll have their own catalogs. This happens in a later module. 

To create a new catalog,

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalogs*.

1. Click *Add* (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)) and enter this information:

   **Name:** Clarity Product Catalog

   **Default Language:** English (United States)

   **Currency:** US Dollar

   ![Enter the name, default language, and currency for the B2B catalog.](./creating-and-configuring-catalogs/images/01.png)

1. Click *Submit*.

After creating a catalog, a base price list and a base promotion list are also created automatically. There’s an option to add a default catalog image. When you don’t have images for products in the catalog, the default catalog image appears as the product image. 

To add the default image, 

1. Click on *Select File* in the *Default Catalog Image* card.

1. Choose `square-color.png` from the library.

1. Click *Save*.

![Add a default catalog image.](./creating-and-configuring-catalogs/images/02.png)

You also have the option to link the catalog to a supplier account. This happens in a later module, so for now, leave the rest of the defaults.
