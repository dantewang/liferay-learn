# Creating Product Relations

You can use product relations to display products for up-selling, cross-selling, selling spares, accessories, or complementary products based on the product being viewed currently. For instance when viewing a syrup, related products can be other syrups in the same price range. You can also create new relations apart from the ones available out-of-the-box. 

Letâ€™s now add a product relation for related products for each product in the catalog.

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Commerce* &rarr; *Products*.

1. Select *Sap Infused Maple Syrup*.

1. Click the *Product Relations* tab. 

1. Click *Add* (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)) and select *Add Related Product*. 

1. In the newly opened window, select the other two products in the catalog. 

1. Click *Add*.

   ![Add two related products for the sap infused maple syrup.](./adding-media/images/01.png)

1. Click *Publish*. 

This creates a product relation between all three products. Repeat this process for the other two products. You'll use these relations when displaying products in the storefront in module three.
