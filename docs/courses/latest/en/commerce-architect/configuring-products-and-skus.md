# Configuring Products and SKUs

After creating channels, a product catalog, warehouses, and products, you must now configure them. This module enriches products with information about various attributes. You'll also dive deeper into creating product relations that lead to more sales opportunities.

By the end of this module, you’ll know how to add product specifications, options, media, configure product relations, and SKUs.

* Specifications depict a single piece of product information. Examples of specifications include dimensions, color, weight, etc. 
* Product options allows your customers to choose different product variants. 
* Product media can include images and attachments that give more information about the product. 
* You can use product relations to create more sales opportunities. Using it, you can display other products that your customers may want to purchase along with the product being viewed currently. 
* SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is the basic unit of a product tracked in inventory. Configuring a SKU includes adding details such as an external reference code, pricing information, inventory information, shipping information, expiry date (if applicable), and more.
