# Configuring Products and SKUs

After creating channels, a product catalog, warehouses, and products, you must now configure them. This module enriches products with information about various attributes. You'll also dive deeper into creating product relations that more sales opportunities.

By the end of this module, you’ll know how to add product specifications, options, media, configure product relations, and SKUs.

* Specifications depict a single piece of product information. Examples of specifications include dimensions, color, weight, etc. 
* Adding options to products allows your customers to choose from different product variants. 
* Product media can include images and attachments that give more information about the product. 
* You can use product relations to set up more sales opportunities by displaying other products that your customers may want to purchase beside the product being viewed currently. 
* SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is the basic unit of a product tracked in inventory. Configuring an SKU includes adding details such as an external reference code, pricing information, inventory information, shipping information, expiry date (if applicable), and more.
