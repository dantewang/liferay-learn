# Building the B2C Storefront

Now that you've created and configured catalogs, channels, products, and warehouses, you’re all set to create and design the storefront. Preston Palmer, the site administrator, needs your help in building out the B2C storefront so Delectable Bonsai’s consumers can view products, place orders, redeem promotions, and more. 

You’ll use the out-of-the-box fragments and widgets to build the site and use the page editor and a client extension to style the pages. 

You’ll start by building the home page of the B2C store. Next, you’ll build a catalog page that displays all the available products with filters that lets you dial down on the exact product you want. 

Next, you’ll create a product details page that displays all the information about a selected product. 

After that, you’ll create the orders page that holds information about pending and placed orders. 

Then, you’ll create a promotion to offer a temporary price reduction on certain products to customers. 

Lastly, you’ll enable guest checkout and complete the purchase of one product utilizing all the features you’ve built. 

<!-- This is good; it again, though, should be fleshed out with more details. What's a fragment and a widget? Offer a short linked description. Show the page editor. What's a client extension? Provide a definition with a link. What's the flow of the shopping experience you're building? Product -> Details -> Orders? How do promotions work? What's the difference between guest checkout and authenticated checkout? Do you still have access to the guest's information (address, email) without an account? How might we use that information later when marketing/advertising? 

Remember that your student readers may be completely new to this technology, and so need these things defined for them so they can understand concepts in context.
