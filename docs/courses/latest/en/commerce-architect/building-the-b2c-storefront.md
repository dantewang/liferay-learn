# Building the B2C Storefront

Now that you’ve created and configured catalogs, channels, products and warehouses, you’re all set to create and design the storefront. Preston Palmer, the site administrator, needs your help in building out the B2C storefront in this module that’ll allow Delectable Bonsai’s consumers to view products, place orders, avail promotions, and more. 

You’ll use the out-of-the-box fragments and widgets to build the site and use the page editor and a client extension to style the pages. 

You’ll start by building the homepage of the B2C store. Next, you’ll build a catalog page that displays all the available products with filters that lets you dial down on the exact product you want. 

Next, you’ll create a product details page that displays all the information about a selected product. 

After that, you’ll create the orders page that holds information about pending and placed orders. 

Then, you’ll create a promotion to offer a temporary price reduction on certain products to customers. 

Lastly, you’ll enable guest checkout and complete the purchase of one product utilizing all the features you’ve built. 

Ready?
