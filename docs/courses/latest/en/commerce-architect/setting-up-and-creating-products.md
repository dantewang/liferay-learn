# Setting Up and Creating Products

Kyle and Damian need your help to create the required channels, catalogs, and products for the B2B and B2C stores. Kyle, the administrator, is in charge of creating the channels, while Damian, the category manager, is responsible for creating the catalogs, products, configuring their prices, and adding inventory.

![The relation between channels, catalogs, products, and warehouses.](./images/01.png)

**Channels**: Channels are scoped to a Liferay instance. A channel is an avenue for selling products, such as a customer portal, a B2B marketplace, or back office phone sales. To sell products on a Liferay site, you must first link it to a channel. 

**Catalogs**: A catalog is scoped to a Liferay instance and stores product information. You can set basic parameters for a catalog like its name, default currency, base price list, base promotion list, and also link it to a supplier account if required.

**Products**: Products are scoped to a catalog. Since there's not relation between a catalog and channel, you must configure a product to display it in a specific channel. You can display products from multiple catalogs in the same channel. 

**Warehouses**: Warehouses in Liferay represent physical locations that store product inventory. 

After completing this module, you'll have

* A product catalog containing different products  
* Channels configured and linked to both sites
* Payment methods and shipping methods set up
* Warehouses that serve both online stores
