# Setting Up and Creating Products

Kyle and Damian need your help in setting up the required channels, catalogs and products for the B2B and B2C stores. Kyle, being the administrator, is in charge of creating the channels, while Damian, being the category manager, is responsible for creating the catalogs, products, configuring their prices, and adding inventory.

After completing this module, you should have:

* A product catalog containing different products
* Channels configured and linked to both sites
* Payment methods and shipping methods set up
* Warehouses that serve both online stores
