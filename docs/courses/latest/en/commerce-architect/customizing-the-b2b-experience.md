# Customizing the B2B Experience

Now that you've completed building Clarity's B2B storefront, it is time to customize the B2B experience. Liferay comes with many B2B-centric features that help businesses cater to their business requirements. In this module, you'll learn how to offer specialized pricing to a set of accounts, use different order types, price tiers, add terms and conditions, and use workflows for buyers. 

**Targeted Pricing:** You'll use Liferay's fine-grained eligibility control to offer specialized pricing for a set of accounts, by creating an account group and then targeting it with a custom [price list](https://learn.liferay.com/w/commerce/pricing/creating-a-price-list). [Account groups](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/users-and-permissions/accounts/account-groups) collect different accounts based on business criteria. 

[**Order Types:**](https://learn.liferay.com/w/commerce/order-management/order-types) Businesses place several orders with Clarity on a day-to-day basis. Orders above $10,000 in value are considered bulk and get an additional 5% discount. You'll create order types with targeted discounts to achieve this. When your business customers place an order of this type, it automatically qualifies for the additional discount.

[**Terms and Conditions:**](https://learn.liferay.com/w/commerce/order-management/terms-and-conditions) Clarity has terms and conditions attached to their payment methods. Based on the chosen payment method, businesses can view the terms and conditions when placing an order. This appears during checkout and is also attached to orders for future reference. 

[**Price Tiers:**](https://learn.liferay.com/w/commerce/pricing/using-price-tiers) Tiered pricing encourages businesses to buy more by offering them discounts when purchasing products at larger quantities.

[**Workflows:**](https://learn.liferay.com/w/commerce/order-management/order-workflows/introduction-to-order-workflows) Fabulous Frames, one of Clarity's customers, want to enable a buyer order approval workflow when placing orders. This ensures that all orders placed by buyers go through an order manager or account administrator for approval.
