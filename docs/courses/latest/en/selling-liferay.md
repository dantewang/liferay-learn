These modules are the starting point for anyone looking to play a part in selling Liferay. Whether you are business or technically aligned you should start here to learn the fundamentals.

## What are Learning Paths?

Learning paths provide a modular approach to learning how to sell Liferay. With the exception of Level 0, each learning path matches a specific role, or roles.  Level 0 is for anyone selling Liferay DXP or for anyone who might interact with Liferay prospects or customers.

All modules are available for all customer facing roles, especially business sales roles, and sales engineer/technical roles. We also recommend that your Liferay developers complete Level 0 and Level 1 for Sales Engineers.

Use the links below to start your learning journey. Whatever your level of knowledge, we recommend starting with Level 0 as it provides a baseline understanding of Liferay the company, and our product and deployment offerings.

## Roles

Learning paths are designed mainly with sellers of Liferay in mind: 

* Account Executives (AEs)
* Sales Engineers (SEs)
* Business Development Representatives (BDRs)
* Sales Development Representatives (SDRs)
* Channel Account Managers (CAMs)

However, this is not a limitation: if you are in Technical or Customer Support, in Customer Success, in Professional or Global Services, in Marketing, you will find value in expanding your Liferay understanding.

## Prerequisites

* Learning paths may have prerequisites---which could be prior learning paths.
* For example Level 0 is a prerequisite for any of the Level 1 learning paths.
* There could also be business and/or technical prerequisites and recommendations. These ensure that the content is aligned with your skills and prior knowledge.
