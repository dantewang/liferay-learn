# Data Modeling and Process Management

Business users can define the fields required for business applications and forms quickly and easily, use underlying capabilities to validate data input, and define conditional rules to allow dynamic form input. Easily enforce business processes with a workflow engine that allows users to define, submit, review, and approve required operational tasks.
