# Design Systems and Experience Management

Design Systems & Experience Management work hand-in-hand, allowing designers to create the foundations of what will be used by site authors to build sites and pages. Design Systems allow non-developer users to create the look and feel of Liferay Applications with little, or potentially no developer involvement. Meanwhile Developers can extend the out-of-the-box capabilities which can then be used by non-developer users to further enhance the end-user experience.
