# Headless APIs and Multichannel

Create unified digital experiences on any channel by connecting all your systems, applications, and data on one platform. Deliver better digital experiences to create more productive online experiences. Headless APIs enable you to deliver unified digital experiences across a wide range of devices and channels, while also making it easier for you to extend the functionality of your Liferay solutions.

Liferay's headless APIs are:

* Standards-based (OpenAPI and GraphQL endpoints)
* Cover nearly all system capabilities (Headless CMS, Headless Commerce, System Administration, etc)
* Multichannel and can be used for Mobile App, Kiosk, and other scenarios
* Traditional REST and JSON APIs are also provided
