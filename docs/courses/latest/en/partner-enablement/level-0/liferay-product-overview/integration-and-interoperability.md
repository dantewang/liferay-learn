# Integration and Interoperability

Integrate external back-end or legacy applications faster and simplify complexity by connecting disparate systems, tools, and data into one unified view. Liferay provides a platform for integrating content and services from back-end or legacy applications. It supports integration with SOAP, REST, GraphQL, RSS, and proprietary APIs, making it easy to unite third-party software, legacy systems, and data, so you can create more productive and efficient user experiences.

![Liferay's low code and API features are a part of Liferay DXP, while Client Extensions can exist outside of the DXP environment.](./integration-and-interoperability/images/01.png)

## Integration Architecture

Makes it easy for developers to exchange data and information between Liferay and external systems.

## Client Extensions

Extend the functionality of Liferay DXP without modifying the code base. Client Extensions sit outside the core, interact with the platform via API, and can be deployed as widgets on pages with OAuth authorization for security.
