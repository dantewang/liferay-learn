# Search and Navigation

Liferay DXP allows you to build digital experiences with dynamic navigation, categories, and search results that can change depending on your audience. The result is a user experience that makes it easy for customers, partners, or employees to locate what they're looking for and discover other highly relevant services, products, or content you can offer them.
