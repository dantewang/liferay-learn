# The Liferay Product

**At a Glance**

* Liferay develops a single Product - Liferay DXP 7.4
* There are three Product Deployment Offerings - Liferay Experience Cloud (LXC) [SaSS], Liferay Experience Cloud - Self Managed [PaaS], or DXP - Self Hosted
* How to identify which Product Deployment Offering is right for your Prospect 

## Background

* Liferay's Product is Liferay DXP.
* Liferay DXP contains three main capability sets, the core Digital Experience Platform, Commerce, and Analytics
* The details of each capability set are covered in a later module. 
* **All** features are now available to customers with a current subscription to Liferay DXP.  
* The deployment approach chosen does not impact the features that are provided.

## Supporting Every Deployment Approach

* Liferay's Product Deployment Offerings allow customers to choose the approach that fits their requirements.
* Liferay Experience Cloud provides a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) deployment model.
* Liferay Experience Cloud Self-Managed provides a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) deplpoyment model.
* Liferay DXP Self-Hosted allows a customer to choose exactly how and where they host their Liferay DXP implemenation.
* This flexibility of deployment is an important differentiator over many of our Competitors, who may not offer anything other than a SaaS deployment option.

```{note}
Although the deplpoyment method for Liferay Experience Cloud is SaaS, this is not a turnkey-application.  
It is the full Digital Experience Platform, on top of which our customers, partners and GS build the tailored solutions our customers need to solve their business problems.
```

As we review each of the deployment approaches, we would like to draw particular attention to the day-to-day activities that are required. Each of these activities has a value, however it is only really delivering the actual business application that is high-value. Some of the lower value activites meanwhile can be quite time-consuming and difficult.  These activities are the responsibility of either Liferay, or the Customer, and each deployment approach assigns these differently.

### DXP Self-Hosted

Traditionally, this is how Liferay DXP has been sold. Customers download a Liferay DXP bundle, or a Liferay DXP Docker Image, and then  are responsible for everything else.

It should not be underestimated how much work is required here. The customer must deploy enough Liferay instances to support their expected peak usage load, must design load-balancing if more than one instance is required, select the infrastructure, how and where that is deployed - on premise, in a private cloud, in a public cloud, they must select the platform sofware like the Database Server.

Then they must maintain that infrastructure, and the platform software, plus patch and upgrade DXP.

Finally they must build their solution on DXP.

### Liferay Experience Cloud Self-Managed

Liferay Experience CLoud Self-Managed (formerly DXP Cloud) is our Platform-as-a-Service offering. Liferay provides the Software itself, and also the infrastructure, all of the Platform Services, and so on.

Plus, with Liferay Experience Cloud Self-Managed there are predefined offers that include things like Backup, VPN services and so on.  Further to this these scale via OOTB HA, auto-scaling capabilities, auto-failover capabilities, and provide load balancing.  These activities are very important, but they can be hard and/or expensive to implement.

Liferay also provides an Infrastructure Uptime SLA of 99.95%, does regular updates to the platform services, provides the full DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline with build management and so on.

But, there are still some time-consuming and relatively low-value activities that are the Customerâ€™s responsibility - like Updates, Patches, Upgrades and finally the high-value Application Delivery work.

**Low Value Activities**

| Responsibility | Liferay | Customer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Products | &#10004; |  |
| Subscription (Support, Warranty, Indemnity, etc) | &#10004; |  |
| Infrastructure (Uptime w/ SLA) | &#10004; |  |

### Liferay Experience Cloud

Finally, LXC provides significant value and simplicity for customers. DXP is hosted and managed on the cloud by Liferay.

```{important}
It is still expected that customers work with Partners and Global Services to solve their business problems on LXC.
```

## A New Development Paradigm for LXC

One of the key benefits for customers who adopt LXC are LXC's **Weekly Updates**. These updates come out every week and fix known issues and add new features. These updates are automatically and transparently applied to all LXC customers on a weekly basis. To enable this approach, customers and teams developing for LXC must shift their development approach from traditional core customizations to use of new Low-Code and Client Extensions available.

Formerly with Liferay, customizations required the deployment of OSGi Modules, Theme .wars, and/or the development of portlets.

![The old Liferay development paradigm.](the-liferay-product/images/02.png)

Liferay DXP 7.4 now supports new ways of extending Liferay without deploying code: [Client Extensions](../../../../../dxp/latest/en/building-applications/client-extensions.md). Using Client Extensions, you can add new capabilities and override native Liferay functions -- without modifying the core of the product.

![The new Liferay DXP 7.4 development paradigm with an emphasis on low-code and Client Extensions.](the-liferay-product/images/03.png)

Shifting development paradigms to this new methodology provides many benefits:

* Improves TCO
* Reduces upgrade risks
* Provides greater flexibility

```{important}
Low-Code features and Client Extensions are available for all deployment models, are **required** for LXC, and are highly recommended for LXC-SM and DXP Self-Hosted.
```

### Common Concerns for Client Extensions and Low-Code Maturity

As of January 2023, Liferay recognizes that Client Extensions cover ~60% of customization needs. We're aggressively working towards ensuring that by September 2023, Client Extensions can cover ~80% of customization needs.

## Solutions and the Solution Marketplace

Liferay develops the core product, Liferay DXP 7.4. We make this product available through the three different product offerings we have already discussed. Finally, Solutions describe what is *implemented* when a customer has purchased a product offering.

![Liferay solutions and their relationship to Liferay's Product and product offerings.](the-liferay-product/images/04.png)

There are many different solutions that can be built and many of these will only be accelerated over time through the use of Site Templates and Accelerators that will be available on the Solution Marketplace!

## Tips for Customers Not Ready for LXC

Here are some common situations for customers who may be reluctant to move to LXC:

* Current implementation requires many different traditional customizations
* Restricted from moving to a SaaS
* Lack of familiarity with Liferay DXP 7.4 or the new development paradigm
* Concerns around stability and completeness of the new architecture

In any of these circumstances, we strongly recommend that teams get up to speed on 7.4 to take advantage of new features, simpler development approaches, and reducing risk to upcoming EOL timelines.

### Customers With Many Customizations

For this situation we recommend:

* Getting current and learning the new architecture and approach
* EOL is coming for 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3
* Developing customizations following the new approach is much less likely to be affected by product changes compared to the use of OSGi modules

For customers who are currently self-hosted, consider using LXC-Self-Managed as a stepping stone to LXC. On LXC-SM all customizations (except for EXT plugins) are available with 7.4.

### Customers Restricted From Moving to SaaS

We recommend:

* Digging into why with a customer. Are there legislative or industrial regulations prohibiting them, or is the rationale purely behavioral?
* Many traditionally conservative industries (Finance, Government) are embracing SaaS
* Talk to the Liferay team about your situation

Regardless, we recommend that all users strive to get current on 7.4 and exploring a migration to LXC-SM which can offer many of the benefits of LXC SaaS.

### Lack of Familiarity With the Low-Code and Client Extensions

Content from Liferay is regularly coming out to make it easier to get started

* New and Updated content covering Client Extensions and Low-Code features is regularly updated on learn.liferay.com
* A full Liferay Application Developer training program covering Low-Code and Client Extensions is being developed and coming in Q2 2023
* Liferay Circles of Success are interactive webinars that regularly highlight new and improved features on 7.4, including low-code and client extensions development options

### Concerns Around Stability and Completeness of the New Architecture

* Stay informed! New capabilities are being developed and released every week. Keep talking to us to find out if your issues have been resolved.
* Use our online resources at learn.liferay.com to start learning and working with 7.4
* Keep the feedback coming! Your feedback is crucial to helping shape the platform and in building success for our customers
