# Managing and Deleting Personal Data

Liferay provides user data tools for managing and deleting personal user data. Though these tools can help with GDPR requirements, they do not guarantee compliance. See [managing user data](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/users-and-permissions/managing-user-data) to learn more.

## Exporting Personal Data

Individuals have a right to request their personal data. Follow the steps to export Tommy Tanner's personal data.

1. Log back into Liferay as the administrator.

1. Navigate to _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Users and Organizations_.

1. Click _Options_ (![Options icon](../../images/icon-actions.png)) for Tommy Tanner. Click _Export Personal Data_.

1. In the next page, click _Add_ (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) to start a new export process.

1. In the next page, select all items you wish to export. For example, select all personal data from message boards. Click _Export_ after making your selection.

1. The next page shows an export process for each category of personal data. To download, click _Options_ (![Options icon](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select _Download_. The personal user data is downloaded to your machine.

1. On your local machine, unzip the downloaded file. The folders contain XML files that are both machine and human readable.

## Anonymizing Personal Data

Choose to anonymize personal data if you want to keep existing content without personally identifiable information.

1. Navigate to _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Users and Organizations_.

1. Click _Options_ (![Options icon](../../images/icon-actions.png)) for Tommy Tanner. Click _Delete Personal Data_. Click _OK_ in the pop-up window explaining that the user must first be deactivated.

1. The next page shows all personal data associated with the user. Choose each category you wish to anonymize. Select the message boards category.

   ![Select each category of data to anonymize.](./managing-and-deleting-personal-data/images/02.png)

1. Click _Options_ (![Options icon](../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to message boards and click _Anonymize_. Click _OK_ in the pop-up window. The user's personal data has now been anonymized (e.g. The message board thread no longer shows Tommy Tanner.)

## Deleting Personal Data

Finally, you can choose to delete personal data completely. This option deletes any data or content the user generated.

1. Navigate to _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Users and Organizations_.

1. Click _Filter and Order_ and select _Inactive_.

1. Click _Options_ (![Options icon](../../images/icon-actions.png)) for Tommy Tanner. Click _Delete Personal Data_.

1. The next page shows all personal data associated with the user. Select the forms category.

1. Click _Options_ (![Options icon](../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the forms category and click _Delete_. Click _OK_ in the pop-up window. 

   Note, some user data, such as form data, requires review and anonymization. On the next page, click _Anonymize_. Click _OK_ in the pop-up window.

1. The next pop-up window gives the option to delete the user. Click _Cancel_ to keep the user.

Congratulations! You have completed this module on user data.
