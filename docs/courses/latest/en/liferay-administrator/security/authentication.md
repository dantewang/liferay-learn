# Authentication 

Liferay's authentication options are flexible enough for almost any scenario you can cook up. From configuring how users sign in, to how authenticated sessions are verified, to configuring more secure authentication via multiple factors, you can configure your Liferay-based website's authentication the way you need it. 

Here, you'll look first at configuring the Sign-In Widget's options, including how users authenticate, how guests interact with the system, password resets, and more. 

Next, you'll see how authentication verifiers can secure your system by verifying the credentials supplied match a user account or an existing authenticated session. 

Finally, you'll configure multi-factor authentication so that users must not only use a password, but also verify via email that they are who they say they are. 

You'll start with [Configuring Sign-In](./authentication/configuring-sign-in.md)
