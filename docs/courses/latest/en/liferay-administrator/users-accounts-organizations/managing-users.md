# Managing Users

Use Liferay to create and manage users for Delectable Bonsai. See [Create and Manage Users](https://learn.liferay.com/en/w/dxp/users-and-permissions/users/adding-and-managing-users) to learn more.

## Creating Users

Instead of continuing to use the default Liferay admin account, create a new Delectable Bonsai administrator account that will go on to create the other users, organizations, and accounts.

```{warning}
In a production environment, you should not use the default admin account. Instead, create admin accounts specific to your business.
```

1. Change the user authentication setting. Note, this is only for our learning and testing purposes.

   * Navigate to _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Instance Settings_.
   * Under Platform, click _User Authentication_.
   * Uncheck the box next to require strangers to verify their email address.
   * Click _Save_.

1. Navigate to _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Users and Organizations_. Click _Add User_ (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)).

1. Enter the following account information:

   * Screen Name: `kyle`
   * Email Address: `kyle@delectablebonsai.com`
   * First Name: `Kyle`
   * Last Name: `Klein`
   * Job Title: `IT Staff`

   Click _Save_. 

1. Give Kyle the administrator role.

   * In the left navigation, click _Roles_.
   * Next to Regular Roles, click _Select_.
   * In the new window, click _Choose_ next to Administrator.
   * Scroll down to the bottom and click _Save_.

1. Set Kyle's password.

   * In the left navigation, click _Password_.
   * Input `test` in the two fields.
   * Click _Save_.

1. Logout of the default admin account and Login as Kyle Klein.

   * Click the user profile image in the top right and click _Sign Out_.
   * Click _Sign In_ at the top right.
   * Sign in with `kyle@delectablebonsai.com` as the email address and `test` as the password.
   * In the next page to reset password, set the new password as `learn`.

Create an account for the IT manager.

1. Navigate to _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Users and Organizations_. Click _Add User_ (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)).

1. Create a user account for Kyle's manager:

   * Screen Name: `marcus`
   * Email Address: `marcus@delectablebonsai.com`
   * First Name: `Marcus`
   * Last Name: `Morgan`
   * Job Title: `IT Manager`

   The list of users should look like this:

   ![The list of users includes Kyle, Marcus, and the default Test account.](./managing-users/images/01.png)

The next step is creating [organizations](./creating-organizations.md).
