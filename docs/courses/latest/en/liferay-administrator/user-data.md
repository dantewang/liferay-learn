# User Data

Businesses often manage user and organizational data separately on an LDAP server. Liferay supports integration with LDAP. You can connect Liferay to the LDAP server and import users.

As users come and go, you can use Liferay's user data management tools to help you manage your customers' and employees' personal data. Here, you'll learn how to 

* Configure an LDAP directory with Liferay
* Import and export from an LDAP directory
* Use Liferay's GDPR tools.

The first step is [connecting Liferay to LDAP](./user-data/connecting-to-ldap.md).
