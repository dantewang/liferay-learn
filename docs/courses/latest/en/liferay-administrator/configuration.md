Now that Liferay is up and running, it is time to configure the environment to suit your business needs. In Liferay, settings can be configured at different scopes or levels. A more granular scope setting will supersede any setting above it. For example, setting a configuration at the site level will supersede any configuration that has been set at the system level or instance level. See [Understanding Configuration Scope](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/system-administration/configuring-liferay/understanding-configuration-scope.html) to learn more.

By the end of this module, you will have:

* Setup an antivirus software to scan any uploaded files across the Liferay system
* Setup a mail server to be used across a Liferay instance
* Setup a separate virtual instance for companies who purchase Delectable Bonsai syrup that are sold under their own branding
* Configure a separate file storage solution

The first step is [Configuring System Settings](./configuration/configuring-system-settings.md).
