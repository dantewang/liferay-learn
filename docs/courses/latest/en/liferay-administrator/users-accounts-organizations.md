<!-- Looking at the organization above, one thing strikes me: it's not a best practice to use the Omni Admin account to do much. The first step should be to have students create an administrative account for Kyle Klein first, and then use that account to do everything else. -Rich -->

With your Liferay DXP environment configured and up and running, it is time to start creating users, organizations, and accounts. 

Now you'll create four user accounts assigned across two different organizations. Users must belong to their respective organizations and be assigned appropriate permissions.

**Kyle Klein** - An IT staffer tasked to help his company, Delectable Bonsai, configure Liferay as their digital experience platform.

**Marcus Morgan** - An IT manager and Kyle's boss. 

**Lily Lewis** - An account manager for Marvelous Markets and staff member of Delectable Bonsai's Sales and Marketing department.

**Noah Norman** - A store manager for Marvelous Markets NYC and the order approver for his staff who places orders from Delectable Bonsai.

The first step is creating some organizations for users. Ready?
