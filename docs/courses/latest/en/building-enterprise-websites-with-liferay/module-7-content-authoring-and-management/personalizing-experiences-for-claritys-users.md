# Personalizing Experiences for Clarityâ€™s Users

As a Digital Experience Platform, Liferay provides out-of-the-box features that can be used to personalize experiences for users. We briefly touched on this earlier in the module when we discussed personalizing collections. This article will dive further into the suite of features that Clarity can use to develop focused experiences for their users. We will cover the following topics:

- Segmentation management
- Personalized experiences
- A/B testing

## Segmentation Management

The first thing you need to do to provide personalization is identify your user segments. Clarity already understands their segments, so now they just need to tell Liferay about them using the Segmentation Management feature. Liferay has a powerful visual rule builder that you can use to create audience segments based on user and organization attributes, as well as session properties and custom fields.

The rule builder uses semantic building blocks, which means you can define segments by constructing a "sentence" that describes the criteria. There are several predefined segmentation rules that you can use, and Liferay also supports the creation of custom fields that you can build rules around. You can also build new segments by combining existing segments, enabling more specific, focused user experiences.

Segmentation integrates with Liferay Analytics Cloud, which adds support for long-time behavior and third party data (such as Salesforce). In addition to the visual user interface, you can also use headless APIs to create custom properties for segmentation.

Once your segments are defined, they are available for use alongside Liferay's site and content management features.

## Personalized Experiences

You can personalize pages for different user segments by creating a Liferay Experience for each segment. This allows you to only show elements and content that are relevant to that segment. You can personalize almost any element of a page, from images and text to fragments and navigation. Additionally, you can create rules that cater to specific breakpoints, such as screen size.

Creating experiences out of segments is an intuitive, non-intrusive part of the site building and content management interfaces that Liferay provides.

Sometimes, we have more than one idea on how to serve a certain audience, but we aren't sure which option is best. This is where A/B testing comes into play.

## A/B Testing

With A/B testing, you can determine the most effective version of your content by testing variations on different sets of users. The majority of users will see the current content and design of your page, while a select group sees an alternative. You can then test the performance of the current version and the variant to determine which performs better for a given goal, such as bounce rate or click-through.

Liferay provides a simple UI for non-technical users to administer A/B tests with granular control over the test configuration and criteria. The tests are automatically synchronized with Liferay Analytics Cloud, which will provide you with test history, statistics, variant performance benchmarks, and more.

In the short term, Clarity can use this feature to determine the best content and click-through path for driving distributors to complete the application process. In the long term, considering their plans for B2C, they can use A/B tests to determine the best promotions or product discovery routes to help customers go from interest to purchase as efficiently as possible. These are a few ways in which A/B testing can help you optimize your business.
