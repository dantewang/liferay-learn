# Publishing Content with Workflows

In the previous sections, you learned about the tools Liferay provides for managing digital assets and web content, and you put some of them to use in enhancing Clarity's enterprise marketing website. However, Clarity's recent growth means that managing this website is no longer an isolated project for a small team or an individual. Rather, it is a complex undertaking that spans multiple departments and internal stakeholders within the organization. As such, Clarity needs standardized approval processes and means for publishing an increasing volume of content and collaborating among its disparate teams.

## Publishing Tools

<!--TODO: Touch on staging a little bit more  -->

While staging can address basic requirements, publications is an advanced and flexible solution for collaborative content management with granular control over publishing. Rather than duplicating content and maintaining two separate datasets, publications work with versioned records. Sets of changes are grouped into a publication. Each publication exists independently and can be permissioned with role-based access control. These are some of the features of publications that satisfy Clarity's business requirements:

- Version control system that allows branching, merging, and tracking changes

- Better collaboration and communication by creating teams with discrete roles for users

- Flexible publishing and streamlined workflow with draft versions, approvals, and scheduling of individual items or entire sets of changes

- Best suited for complex sites with frequent changes managed by multiple teams

- Reliable rollback when human error occurs and reversion is necessary.

Publications are ideal when there are frequent changes involving multiple departments that must be published at different times. For their enterprise marketing website, Clarity chooses publications over staging as their collaboration and publishing solution.

## Workflows

Workflows ensure that changes go through the right gates during the publishing process. Liferay ships with a *Single Approver* workflow out of the box that requires a second set of eyes on your work. In addition to this basic workflow, Liferay provides a visual designer that you can use to define your own custom workflows.

Workflows can be associated with different asset types so you don't have to use the same approval process for everything. This flexibility also allows you to assign different workflows to different individuals or teams within your organization. Both staging and publications can accommodate approvals through workflows.

These are some of the features that make workflows a critical part of publishing and governing content with Liferay:

- Automate repetitive tasks like approvals, notifications, and content routing to save time

- Reduce the risk of human error from manual processes with automated steps and rules

- Assign specific tasks and approvals to designated users, clarifying roles and responsibilities and creating transparency throughout the process

- Improve communication by automating notifications that keep stakeholders informed about progress and status

- Improve review processes with structured feedback loops

- Build flexible solutions by customizing workflows for your specific needs

- Integrate workflows seamlessly with other Liferay features, including headless APIs
