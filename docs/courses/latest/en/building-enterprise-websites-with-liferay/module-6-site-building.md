In the previous modules, we've seen how Clarity can leverage Liferay's user management features to import users, set up B2B accounts, and establish role-based access control. Now, it’s time to start building Clarity’s public site! Liferay provides out-of-the-box tools for designing personalized website experiences across multiple channels and devices with ease. With a drag-and-drop visual page editor, Liferay's site building tools empower non-technical users to create and preview web pages without needing to write code. This allows for greater agility and content ownership. Liferay also provides more technical users with advanced features for extending a site's style and creating page elements with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout this module, you'll take on the role of Walter Douglas, Clarity's web developer, and experience how Liferay's intuitive interface empowers him to implement site architecture, styling, and page design with speed and ease.
