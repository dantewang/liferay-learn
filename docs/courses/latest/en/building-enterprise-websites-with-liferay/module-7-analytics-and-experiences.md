# Module 7: Analytics and Experiences

At this stage in the course, you have learned how to configure your Liferay DXP instance, design Clarity's enterprise website, and populate the site with various types of content. While Clarity now has a viable marketing solution, this is just the starting point. A digital-minded organization needs to be analytics-driven to continually measure and optimize its performance, which means its creators, designers, and administrators must be empowered to leverage data as a part of their everyday workflow. With Liferay's Analytics Cloud, Clarity can do just that. 

Analytics Cloud is a suite of tools for measuring user engagement data and assessing site performance, providing metrics at the site, page, asset, and user levels. By understanding how your content is performing, you can also understand who your audience is and what they're looking for in a digital experience solution. Rather than just presenting you with data, however, Analytics Cloud lets you take it a step further with personalized experiences. 

Once you have identified and classified user personas with Analytics Cloud, you can build segments based on user attributes, interests, and behaviors. You can then deliver personalized site experiences to different user segments. Better experiences lead to better engagement, customer retention, and brand loyalty. This type of personalization has the additional benefit of enabling A/B Testing, a powerful tool for improving site experiences in a dynamic, agile fashion.

In this module, you will learn about the following Liferay features:

- Analytics Cloud
- User Segments
- Personalized Experiences
- A/B Testing
