# Module 8: Headless APIs

!!! important "Webinar Note"
    This module was presented using slides for a live webinar audience. The formatting, presentation, and examples may differ from what is presented here as part of the course.

In the previous modules, you learned about building site pages and creating site content with Liferay in the context of Clarity's enterprise marketing website. Because creating new content requires significant effort, Clarity wants to import some of the existing content from their previous portal application so they can get up and running faster. Migrating legacy content is one of many use cases solved by Liferay's Headless APIs.

In this module, you'll learn about Liferay's Headless API capabilities and how you can leverage them in your software integrations.
