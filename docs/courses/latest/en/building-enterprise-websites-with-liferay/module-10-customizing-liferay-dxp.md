So far you've learned about using Liferay's out-of-the-box features to build enterprise websites. While these features cover many use cases, unique business requirements may necessitate customizing the Liferay platform. Fortunately, Liferay provides extensive tools for building custom solutions that integrate seamlessly with Liferay's core frameworks. Using low-code capabilities like objects together with client extensions, you can streamline critical business processes and enhance the Liferay platform without modifying its core.

In this module, you will

* Learn best practices for using objects and client extensions
* Apply frontend client extensions to modify Clarity's appearance
* Set up a custom solution for Clarity to onboard distributors
* Implement business logic to integrate Clarity's solution with Liferay DXP
