# Applying Clarity's Brand Styling

Liferay empowers users with a set of powerful styling tools for both technical and non-technical users, ensuring a consistent visual identity and user experience across your website. As previously explained, these tools, including themes, style books, frontend client extensions, and page element configurations. Together, they can streamline development and integrate existing styles.

So far, we've used the classic theme's default styling options. In this lesson, you'll use the Theme CSS client extension to overwrite these options. You'll also update the site's favicon and logo to make the platform align more closely with Clarity's branding.
