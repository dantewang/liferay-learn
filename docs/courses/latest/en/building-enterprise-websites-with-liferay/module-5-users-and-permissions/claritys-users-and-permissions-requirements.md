# Clarity's Users and Permissions Requirements

User management is an important part of any organization's IT procedures and policies. Managing users goes beyond just providing view access based on roles and permissions. User management is about determining what permissions users have into things such as application UI functionality, content creation, sensitive information and more. Having good user management is especially critical in a company's lifecycle such a in onboarding or offboarding their employees.

## Requirements

As a growing organization, Clarity has some processes in place, but there's definitely room for improvement. Let's look a little closer at some of the specific requirements Clarity has for its users.

### User management that is capable by non-technical team members

Liferay's robust user management tools come ready to use all from within the Liferay UI. No programming or custom code is required to create and manage users. Even customization such as custom fields or custom roles can be accomplished from the UI. This means that non-technical team members can cover all aspects of managing users without the need for IT staff. Some examples include managing roles and permissions, managing organizations and user groups, and leveraging accounts.

### Precise permissioning tools that provide Clarity users with the necessary and appropriate platform privileges

With Liferay's permissioning tools, you can create precise roles with specific permissions. In Liferay, permissions are additive for each role, as opposed to subtractive. This means that users will only have the permissions that you assign and intend for them to have. This way, you ensure that users only have access to the things they need.

### Reduce management time and costs through reusable user segments

In Liferay, permissions are not only assignable to roles but also to user groups. If users in a specific group should have the same access and permissions on the platform, it makes sense for them to be grouped together with one set of permissions. Furthermore, user groups can be assigned automatically from user directories, as we saw in the previous module. This saves time and energy because new users who authenticate to Liferay won't need roles or permissions assigned to them, but will automatically receive the appropriate permissions of their user group.

## Conclusion

Now let's move on to some initial set up we need for Clarity's team members.
