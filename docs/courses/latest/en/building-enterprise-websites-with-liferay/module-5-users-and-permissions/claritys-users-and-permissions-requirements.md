# Clarity's Users and Permissions Requirements

Before we talk about the different ways to manage users and set permissions, let's look a little closer at some of the specific requirements Clarity has for its users.

### Clarity wants non-technical team members to be able to manage users.

Liferay's robust user management tools come ready to use all from within the Liferay UI. No programming or custom code is required to create and manage users. Even customization such as custom fields or custom roles can be accomplished from the UI. This means that non-technical team members can cover all aspects of managing users without the need for IT staff. Some examples include managing roles and permissions, managing organizations and user groups, and leveraging accounts.

### Clarity wants all users to have the necessary and appropriate platform privileges.

With Liferay's permissioning tools, you can create precise roles with specific permissions. In Liferay, permissions are additive for each role, as opposed to subtractive. This means that users will only have the permissions that you assign and intend for them to have. This way, you ensure that users only have access to the things they need.

### Clarity wants reusable user segments to reduce management time and costs.

In Liferay, permissions are not only assignable to roles but also to user groups. If users in a specific group should have the same access and permissions on the platform, it makes sense for them to be grouped together with one set of permissions. Furthermore, user groups can be assigned automatically from user directories, as we saw in the previous module. This saves time and energy because new users who authenticate to Liferay won't need roles or permissions assigned to them, but will automatically receive the appropriate permissions of their user group.

Now let's move on to how the different user management tools can be used in Clarity's use case.
