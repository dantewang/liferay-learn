# Securing Clarity Content

Liferay's permission system provides a fine-grained way to grant permissions to users. Remember that permissions in Liferay are additive, versus being subtractive. Therefore, when defining permissions for custom roles, add only the permissions that role needs. This ensures that content stays secure and access is granted only to those who need it.

A permission in Liferay is defined as an specific action that you can perform on a specific resource. Some examples of actions are create or add, delete, update, view, etc. Some examples of resources in Liferay are blog posts, documents, users, specific applications, etc. So a specific permission might be the privilege to update blog posts.
