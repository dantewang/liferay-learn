# Securing Clarity Content

Liferay's granular permissions ensure precise control over data and application access at multiple levels. Remember that Liferay uses an additive permissions model. This means users only inherit permissions explicitly assigned to their role, helping ensure that content stays secure and access is granted only to those who need it.

Each permission grants the ability to perform a specific action (e.g., create, delete, update, view) on a particular resource (blog posts, documents, users, applications). So an example of a permission is the ability to update blog posts.

<!--Q: Should we introduce the distinction between Application permissions and Resource permissions, per the Liferay UI?

Application permissions grant access to the published object itself and do not include resource-related permissions.

Resource permissions grant access to view, create, and act on application data. Some of these permissions relate to creating data entries, while others are for performing actions on existing data entries.
