# Module 10: Building Applications

!!! important "Webinar Note"
    This module was presented using slides for a live webinar audience. The formatting, presentation, and examples may differ from what is presented here as part of the course.

    * View the [recording](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/d/lp1-10-building-applications) from the live webinar of this module.

So far, you've learned about using Liferay's powerful out-of-the-box features to build a modern enterprise marketing website with a centralized technical infrastructure. Sometimes these features don't cover all the functionality you require, and you will need to develop your own applications to interface with Liferay.

Clarity's presence as a global leader in optical technology has drawn interest from a growing number of international distributors. To address this interest, they need to develop a custom solution for receiving and approving applications from B2B distributors. Clarity can do just that with one of Liferay's key differentiators: low-code applications.

The purpose of this module is to show you what's possible with low-code applications in Liferay with a practical solution provided to you as an example. In a later, dedicated course, we will dive much deeper into Liferay's features and capabilities for low-code application development.

In this module, you will deploy the prebuilt solution yourself and learn about the following concepts at a high level:

* Modeling data structures that integrate with Liferay's core frameworks
* Implementing business logic to operate on those data structures
* Designing user interfaces that unify custom applications with enterprise websites

You'll be able to explore the application as we discuss its corresponding features through the course of the module.
