# Module 10: Building Applications

!!! important "Webinar Note"
    This module was presented using slides for a live webinar audience. The formatting, presentation, and examples may differ from what is presented here as part of the course.

So far, you've learned about using Liferay's out-of-the-box features to build enterprise websites. While these features cover many use cases, unique business needs may require custom applications. Fortunately, Liferay provides extensive tools for building custom applications that seamlessly integrate with Liferay's core frameworks. Using low-code capabilities and client extensions, you can enhance the Liferay platform and streamline critical business processes without modifying its core.

Here, you will deploy a prebuilt solution for Clarity Vision Solutions and learn how to

* Model data structures integrated with Liferay's core frameworks
* Implement business logic to operate on those data structures
* Design user interfaces that unify custom applications with enterprise websites

Before deploying the application, let's review Clarity Vision Solutions' requirements. This will provide context for the prebuilt solution and showcase how Liferay Objects and client extensions address their specific needs.
