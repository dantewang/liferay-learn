# Module 10: Building Applications

So far, you've learned about using Liferay's powerful out-of-the-box features to build a modern enterprise marketing website with a centralized technical infrastructure. Sometimes these features don't cover all the functionality you require, and you will need to develop your own applications to interface with Liferay.

Clarity's presence as a global leader in optical technology has drawn interest from a growing number of international distributors. To address this interest, they need to develop a custom solution for receiving and approving applications from B2B distributors. Clarity can do just that with one of Liferay's key differentiators: Low Code Applications.

In this module, you will learn about the following concepts at a high level:

* Modeling data structures that integrate with Liferay's core frameworks
* Implementing business logic to operate on those data structures
* Designing user interfaces that unify custom applications with enterprise websites.

While the *Application Building* <!--placeholder course name--> course will dive much deeper into the technical details of creating an application from scratch, the purpose of this module is to show you what's possible with low code applications in Liferay. To that end, we're providing you with a prebuilt distributor application solution for Clarity. You'll be able to explore the application as we discuss its corresponding features throughout the module.
