# Designing User Interfaces

Liferay gives you the tools for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces for your custom applications. You can use page builder features like fragments and widgets in site pages to design forms, display object data, and more, creating seamless site experiences for your users.

Originally, Clarity's distributor application solution used standard object layouts and views. While these are serviceable for administrative users, they have limited customization options. Clarity has instead used Liferay's page building tools to integrate the distributor application with the website's user interface. You can see what these pages look like below.
