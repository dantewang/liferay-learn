# Clarity's Customization Requirements

Building custom functionality is a time-consuming and complex process that often requires dedicated developer resources. Modifying out-of-the-box behavior can be difficult or even impossible without such resources. Overcoming these challenges requires a flexible customization approach that can adapt and leverage existing platform features.

With Liferay's low-code capabilities and extension points, Clarity can build the solutions they need without the complexity, overhead, or resource burden typically associated with traditional development. As a global leader in optical technology, Clarity has drawn interest from a growing number of international distributors. To address this interest, Clarity needs a custom solution for receiving and approving distributor applications.

## Requirements

With this solution in mind, let's review Clarity's development requirements.

### Reduce strain on IT resources and accelerate delivery with low-code/no-code capabilities

Liferay Objects offers low-code/no-code capabilities for building custom applications. With a user-friendly interface, both technical and non-technical stakeholders can define data structures and implement business logic without code. Objects can also serve as the foundation for more complex customizations with client extensions. Taken together, these features empower Clarity to build solutions that align with their specific needs without overburdening IT resources.

### Customize the platform without modifying its core

In addition to Objects, Liferay provides both microservice and frontend client extensions for customizing the platform without modifying its core. Developers can leverage Liferay microservice client extensions to define custom business logic (e.g., validations, notifications, and actions) hosted outside Liferay and triggered by platform events. They can also use custom element client extensions to render external applications as widgets in Liferay pages. This enables Clarity's developers to build highly customized applications while maintaining platform stability.

### Develop integrated solutions without extensive Liferay knowledge

To maximize developer productivity and accelerate time-to-market, Clarity requires a development environment that minimizes the learning curve associated with Liferay. Liferay's intuitive visual development tools, pre-built sample solutions, and comprehensive documentation set up practitioners for success in developing custom integrated solutions.

### Give developers freedom to use their preferred languages and tools

Clarity wants to develop custom components in common programming languages (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Python) using standard, well-defined APIs. Liferay practitioners can develop client extensions using their own established workflows and package them as containers for easy deployment and management.

## Conclusion

By addressing these requirements, Liferay can empower Clarity to build custom solutions efficiently and effectively, without compromising on quality or developer experience. Now that we've reviewed Clarity's requirements, let's take a closer look at client extensions.
