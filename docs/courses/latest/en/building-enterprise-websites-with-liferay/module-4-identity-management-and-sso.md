# Module 4: Identity Management & SSO

Now with the [developer setup](./module-2-developer-setup.md) complete and [Liferay deployed](./module-3-deploying-liferay.md), Clarity can start inviting its team members to Liferay.

Visitors that come to Clarity's website will be anonymous as they are not logged in. However, Clarity team members need to be logged in users that will use Liferay's various site-building features. With ever increasing security threats, utilizing identity management tools such as multi-factor authentication and single sign-on is critical to any business. Clarity is considering their different options as they look to make user access more streamlined and more secure.

In this module, you will:

* Learn about the different identity management tools that are available in Liferay
* See the different single sign-on solutions that can be used in conjunction with Liferay
* Walk through an example of integrating Okta single sign-on with Liferay
