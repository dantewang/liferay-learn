Congratulations! You've completed Module 10: Customizing Liferay DXP. Throughout this module, you've learned best practices for customizing the Liferay platform with objects and client extensions. You put these best practices into action by setting up Clarity's custom solution for onboarding distributors and implementing business logic to integrate it with Liferay's out-of-the-box capabilities.
