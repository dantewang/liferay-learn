# Clarity's Deployment Requirements

Choosing the right deployment approach is key to the success of any organization's web-based solutions. This choice can significantly impact a solution's functionality, scalability, and security. Some organizations may require their data and infrastructure to stay in-house for regulatory compliance, necessitating a self-hosted deployment model. Others might prioritize speed and scalability, making Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) options more suitable. Ultimately, understanding these diverse needs is important to choosing the best deployment approach for an organization.

## Requirements

With this in mind, let's look at Clarity's business needs and the specific requirements they have around deployment.

### Reduce the need for multiple IT systems when creating and maintaining their website

Along with a full suite of site building tools, Liferay offers a robust content management system, integrated commerce capabilities, advanced search functionalities, and more. Having these capabilities bundled together eliminates the need for multiple, disparate systems and simplifies license management. Furthermore, Liferay's PaaS and SaaS offerings provide the cloud infrastructure they need for scaling and reliability, eliminating the need for internal infrastructure management and ensuring high availability even during peak traffic periods.

### Reduce the technical barrier to website building and maintenance

Liferay's intuitive user interface empowers Clarity to build and manage their website with minimal technical expertise. No coding or technical background is needed. Tasks like site building, user management, analytics, and even e-commerce can be accomplished without coding or specialized knowledge. This user-friendly approach reduces reliance on specialized personnel, enabling broader team participation in website development and maintenance.

### Choose a scalable offering that can grow with them

Liferay is ready to scale whether a company grows to thousands of employees using the platform or thousands of visitors navigating its websites. Clarity mostly serves other businesses for now, but in the future, Liferay can grow with them to support an e-commerce store to serve consumers. Spinning up new websites on a Liferay instance can be done with just a few clicks. Auto-scaling and node clustering can also be configured to handle high volumes of site traffic.

## Conclusion

Now let's explore Liferay's deployment options and review some key considerations when determining which option is best for an Organization.
