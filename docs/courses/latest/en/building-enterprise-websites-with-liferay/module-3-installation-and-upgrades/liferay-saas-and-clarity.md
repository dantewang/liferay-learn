# Liferay SaaS and Clarity

The three deployment options (i.e. Liferay SaaS, Liferay PaaS, and Liferay Self-Hosted) are all potential options for Clarity. Some businesses may prefer to have exclusive control over their technology stack or to keep their data on-premises. However, after a number of years of piecing together different systems and solutions, Clarity is ready to simplify their approach by choosing Liferay SaaS.

At a high level:

* Liferay SaaS is the best solution for Clarity. Some of the benefits are lower cost and overhead, greater security, and greater scalability.

## Lower Cost and Overhead

Clarity will save time and money moving to Liferay SaaS. In the past, Clarity has purchased tools and licenses for various systems to keep their website and operations running. Now with Liferay SaaS they can bring all the tools under one roof. Some ways Liferay SaaS will save Clarity time and money:

* No need for separate cloud infrastructure costs
* No need for specialized personnel to administer a complex infrastructure
* No need for separate licenses (e.g. cloud storage, e-commerce, site security, etc.)




In Liferay SaaS, Liferay manages the cloud infrastructure and Liferay DXP application, so you can focus on what matters to your business. Your work is primarily with Liferay's out-of-the-box features. Custom development is still available through [client extensions](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions).

## Initial Setup

When your project is provisioned, you will receive:
- an email from **liferay.cloud** inviting you to set a password for your new administrator account on your Liferay DXP instance.
- an email invitation to the extension environments. Click on *Accept Invite* and you'll be redirected to the [Liferay Cloud console](https://console.liferay.cloud/) for login.

Log in to the cloud console to access your extension environments. Deploy custom services (i.e. client extensions) that integrate with your Liferay instance.
