# The Clarity Story

!!! abstract
    Clarity's decentralized technical infrastructure and ineffective marketing website have led to inefficiencies, high maintenance costs, and slowing growth.

Founded in 2010, Clarity Vision Solutions is an eyewear manufacturer that has experienced tremendous growth and success in a very short period of time. What started as a small business has exploded into an organization with a Global footprint. One of the biggest contributors to their success has been their early investment in digital commerce. With more than 500 employees and upwards of 300 million dollars in revenue, Clarity is ready for the next stage of its strategy—working with international distributors to expand their offering via a strong partner network. However, their current technical infrastructure has become overly complex and outdated, leading to inefficiencies, high maintenance costs, and limitations on potential growth.

These pain points fall into two main categories: their [decentralized technical infrastructure](#decentralized-technical-infrastructure) and [ineffective marketing website](#ineffective-website-and-site-development-tools).

## Decentralized Technical Infrastructure
<!--TASK: Determine whether to add a diagram for this category of pain points-->

Over the years, Clarity has added multiple systems on an ad hoc basis, causing their tools and data to become decentralized silos. This has hindered information flow and collaboration, impeding both operational efficiency and strategic decision making. Additionally, the maintenance of these systems requires multiple licenses, integrations, and specialized personnel, leading to increased costs and diverting resources from core business initiatives.

Clarity's decentralized IT infrastructure has also raised concerns about data security. With limited oversight and visibility across their systems, complying with global data privacy regulations has become a significant challenge. Currently, they struggle to maintain consistent data governance and implement effective security controls. Failing to address these issues could lead to compliance violations and legal repercussions, damaging the brand's reputation and impacting their ability to operate in certain markets.

## Ineffective Website and Site Development Tools
<!--TASK: Determine whether to add a diagram for this category of pain points-->

Clarity's current marketing website has also struggled to keep pace with their rapid growth. With a complex design interface, updating and maintaining the website requires extensive technical knowledge. This prevents non-technical team members with valuable company knowledge from contributing to the site.

As a result, the website suffers from an outdated design and inconsistent brand identity that fails to reflect their innovative spirit and commitment to excellence. Furthermore, the lack of segmentation and other personalization capabilities has prevented them from connecting with visitors on a personal level and delivering engaging experiences. <!--ALT: They lack the tools to dynamically curate content, recommend relevant products, or offer individualized offers, preventing them from connecting with visitors on a personal level.--> This has led to an increase in bounce rates, hindering Clarity’s ability to convert online traffic.

## Critical Success Factors

Taken together, Clarity's fragmented technical infrastructure and ineffective marketing website stifle their potential in the increasingly competitive eyewear market. To address these challenges, Clarity Vision Solutions requires a strategic approach built upon several critical success factors:
<!--ALT FROM WEBINAR: Overcoming these challenges is a major effort. And Clarity’s stakeholders all agree that finding and implementing the right solution is necessary for the success of their growth milestone.

However, success can mean different things for different stakeholders, and failure to align on what a successful outcome looks like up front can cause major problems down the road. So the Clarity team has defined six Critical Success Factors. These factors will be used as both a guide for vetting ideas and a benchmark for determining whether their business objectives have been achieved.

Let’s dig deeper into each of these factors now.
-->

* **Non-Technical Participation**: Empower non-technical team members to contribute to content creation and website management through user-friendly interfaces and intuitive tools, democratizing website ownership and fostering collaboration.

<!--FROM WEBINAR: Currently, Clarity struggles with user empowerment and collaboration, making internal teams feel dependent on the resources of other departments, especially IT, which is stretched thin by rapid growth and competing priorities. This creates a "hurry up and wait" model that limits productivity. In order to unlock the full potential of their organization’s resources, the solution that they adopt must allow those without a degree in computer science to manage content and build basic tools to get the job done. -->

* **Unified Platform and Simplified Maintenance**: Simplify IT administration by consolidating disparate systems into a unified platform, streamlining website maintenance and freeing both IT and financial resources for strategic initiatives.

<!--FROM WEBINAR: Clarity’s complex systems require a team of experts, causing financial and deadline challenges due to limited resource availability. With many closed systems or black boxes in use, addressing new needs with new tools leads to escalating costs. As sales stabilize, operational costs become a focus. Clarity seeks a single platform with customizable capabilities to meet immediate needs and allow for future growth, enabling quick responses to market changes while managing costs efficiently. -->

* **Future-Proof Scaling and Flexibility**: Use a platform that can readily adapt to evolving business needs and technological advancements, accommodating future growth and expansion without costly re-implementations. The right solution is one that can grow and adapt as the business grows.

<!--FROM WEBINAR: Meeting the needs of the business today is important but possibly more important is the ability to respond to new demands in a timely manner. The best possible platform is one that both offers feature rich functionality on day one and caters to the needs of the unknown by providing some way to extend its capabilities. Whether this is managed through a plugin based solution model or a rich framework for integrating with external systems, flexibility is paramount in order to future proof the solution. Clarity recognizes that to remain at the forefront of their business they need the ability to respond quickly to new opportunities as they surface. -->

* **Increased Engagement through Personalization**: Leverage data insights to deliver personalized omnichannel experiences to customers, fostering deeper engagement and boosting conversions.

<!--FROM WEBINAR: Understanding your customer is critical when trying to find the best strategy for converting a lead to a close. The world we live in today is not only influenced but driven by the consumer. When you don’t know who your customer is, or what their pain points are, then you are essentially shooting in the dark. 

Over the years, Clarity has gathered copious amounts of data on customers and those interested in their products. Realizing the potential value of this data, Clarity has identified several personas into which users can be grouped’ to improve targeting and engagement.  

The right solution for Clarity must empower them to leverage this data to elevate the way they engage with their users. Along with this requirement, Clarity wants to eliminate its current dependence on the IT department to craft these experiences. As such, the solution needs to be “business user friendly” allowing them to build new experiences and personas (segments) with autonomy. -->

* **Risk Mitigation with Better Governance**: Implement robust cybersecurity measures and data governance practices to mitigate risks, ensure compliance with global regulations, and build trust with customers and partners.

<!--FROM WEBINAR: As with any large organization, Clarity must mitigate external risks and ensure internal adherence to both corporate policy and global regulations. They need assurances that (whether homegrown or purchased from a third party vendor) the final solution will be auditable and provide protection for all forms of Cybersecurity measures. And if any threats are identified, they must be able to deal with them quickly, either by a vendor partner or by applying a software patch.

These measures can help guard against both internal and external threats, but there is another threat that can arise from within a firewall. While not necessarily done with malicious intent, it’s human nature to find the shortest path to success. This often manifests itself as employees deciding that one or more steps in a business process are unnecessary. These decisions may seem benign to the individual, but they can severely compromise standards of compliance and overall security integrity. As such Clarity has identified the need to enforce a governance model using a series of gates and checks, applying permissions only to the necessary roles to mitigate these internal risks. -->

* **Lower Total Cost of Ownership**: Optimize technology costs by consolidating services in a centralized platform and reducing dependence on external IT resources. This can maximize transparency/access of data and enable users to reuse existing assets to compose new solutions.

<!--FROM WEBINAR: Clarity’s exponential growth has led to unsustainable costs. At this critical point, a solution is needed to centralize common business functions into a single system.

To facilitate this, the solution must provide public APIs for integrating with both internal and external systems so that integration doesn’t require funding lengthy, costly projects. Maximizing internal talent is crucial, requiring a solution that allows for self-management of sites and applications by the business itself. -->

With these factors in mind, let's explore how Liferay DXP can empower Clarity to overcome their obstacles and deliver the solutions they need.
