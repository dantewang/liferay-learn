!!! abstract
    In this course you'll build an enterprise marketing website for Clarity following both business and IT personas.

Throughout this course, we will build an enterprise marketing website for Clarity Vision Solutions. This site is designed to increase brand awareness, showcase their products, and convert visitors to customers.

Here we'll review the site's designs and the personas we'll follow throughout our journey.

## Enterprise Website Designs

Clarity's website development team has produced this site map for their initiative:

This provides a blueprint for Clarity's website. Each page plays a specific role, from showcasing innovative products (e.g., Products) to highlighting the company's core values (e.g., About Us).

To help us transform this blueprint into a vibrant and engaging online experience, Clarity's design team has produced these mockups for each page in Figma. Before moving on to the next module, take some time to look over these designs and get an idea of what you'll be building.
