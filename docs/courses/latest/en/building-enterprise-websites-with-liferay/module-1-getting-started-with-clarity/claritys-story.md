# Clarity's Story

Founded in 2010, Clarity has quickly grown into a global leader in optical technology and design. With over 500 employees and $300m+ in revenue, their precision lenses and stylish frames bring clarity and confidence to customers worldwide. However, their current technical infrastructure<!--w/c; architecture?--> has become overly complex and outdated, leading to inefficiencies, high maintenance costs, and limitations on potential growth.

These pain points fall into two main categories: their [decentralized technical infrastructure](#decentralized-technical-infrastructure) and [ineffective marketing website](#ineffective-website-and-site-development-tools).

## Decentralized Technical Infrastructure

Over the years, Clarity has added multiple systems on an ad hoc basis, causing their tools and data to become decentralized silos. This has hindered information flow and collaboration and impeded operational efficiency and strategic decision making. Additionally, the maintenance of these systems requires multiple licenses, integrations, and specialized personnel, leading to increased costs and diverting resources from core business initiatives.

Clarity's decentralized IT infrastructure has also raised concerns about data security. With limited oversight and visibility across their systems, complying with global data privacy regulations has become a significant challenge. Currently, they struggle to maintain consistent data governance and implement effective security controls. Failing to address these issues could lead to compliance violations and legal repercussions, damaging the brand's reputation and impacting their ability to operate in certain markets.

## Ineffective Website and Site Development Tools

Clarity's current marketing website has also struggled to keep pace with their rapid growth. With a complex design interface, updating and maintaining the website requires extensive technical knowledge. This prevents non-technical team members with valuable company knowledge from contributing to the site.

As a result, the website suffers from an outdated design and inconsistent brand identity that fails to reflect their innovative spirit and commitment to excellence. The lack of segmentation and other personalization capabilities has prevented them from connecting with visitors on a personal level. <!--ALT: They lack the tools to dynamically curate content, recommend relevant products, or offer individualized offers, preventing them from connecting with visitors on a personal level.--> Also, slow page load times and clunky navigation have resulted in negative user experiences, causing high bounce rates and hindering Clarity's ability to convert online traffic.

## Conclusion

Taken together, Clarity's fragmented technical infrastructure and ineffective marketing website threaten to stifle their potential in the increasingly competitive eyewear market. Clarity needs a unifying digital platform that eliminates silos, improves security, and fosters seamless information flow across all departments. They also need a user-friendly solution that enables non-technical users to help build engaging, personalized digital experiences.
