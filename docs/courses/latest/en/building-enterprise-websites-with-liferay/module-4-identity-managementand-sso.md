# Module 4: Identity Management & SSO

Now with the [developer setup](./module-2-developer-setup.md) complete and [Liferay deployed](./module-3-deploying-liferay.md), Clarity can start inviting its team members to Liferay.

Visitors that come to Clarity's website will be anonymous as they are not logged in users. However, Clarity team members will be logged in users. With ever increasing security threats identity management and authentication services such as single sign-on is very important.

In this module, you will:

* Learn about the identity management tools and different authentication services that are available in Liferay
* Walk through an example of integrating Okta single sign-on with Liferay

Next: [Liferay Deployment Options](./module-4-identity-management-sso/identity-management-options.md)
