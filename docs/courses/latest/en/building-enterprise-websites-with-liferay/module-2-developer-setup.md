Liferay provides a variety of tools to streamline site and application development to deliver engaging digital experiences. In the previous module, you learned about Clarity's business needs and how Liferay can empower them to build public enterprise websites on a single platform. You also learned about the solution you'll build throughout this course. Next you'll set up your local developer environment. While this isn't the first step for most of Clarity's employees, it is important for Clarity's IT team and necessary for completing this course's exercises.

Here you'll learn about Liferay Workspace and Client Extensions, two essential features for building custom solutions with Liferay.
