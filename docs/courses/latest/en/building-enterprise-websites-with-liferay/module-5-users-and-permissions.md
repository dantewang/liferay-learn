# Module 5: Users & Permissions

!!! important "Webinar Note"
    This module was presented using slides for a live webinar audience. The formatting, presentation, and examples may differ from what is presented here as part of the course.

    * View the [recording](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/d/lp1-5-users-permissions) from the live webinar of this module.
    * Download the [PDF](https://learn.liferay.com/documents/d/guest/lp1-5-users-permissions-pdf) of the presentation used in the live workshop.

In the previous module, we saw how Clarity Vision Solutions can authenticate and manage users with SSO services (Okta). Here we'll shift out focus to authorization and learn best practices for managing user permissions. Where authentication verifies user identities, authorization determines what Liferay applications and resources users can access as well as the actions they can perform. This module explores how to grant the right level of platform permissions to users so they can do everything they need to do and nothing they shouldn't.

After completing this module, you will know how to

* Create users, user groups, and roles in Liferay DXP.
* Streamline role management with user groups.
* Assign granular permissions to roles to ensure appropriate access to Liferay applications and resources.
