# Module 5: Users & Permissions

!!! important "Webinar Note"
    This module was presented using slides for a live webinar audience. The formatting, presentation, and examples may differ from what is presented here as part of the course.

In the previous module, we saw Clarity bring over their team members through Okta, along with the user groups they belong to. In this module, we’re going to learn best practices on how to use Liferay features to manage these new Liferay users. Grant the right amount of platform access and permissions so that users can do everything they need to do and nothing they shouldn't.

In this module, you will learn:

* The specific users and permissions requirements Clarity has
* How to do some initial set up for Clarity's team members
* How to use Liferay’s user management tools and manage permissions
* How to use Liferay permissions to secure Clarity content
