# Deploying Liferay

Liferay offers three different deployment options (i.e. Liferay SaaS, Liferay PaaS, and Liferay Self-Hosted). Now that Clarity has selected Liferay, they need to understand the different options and choose the approach that best suits their situation. In the end, they choose Liferay SaaS for the ease of use and the ability to get up-and-running immediately.

In this module you will learn:

* The ins and outs of the three different Liferay deployment approaches.
* The reasons why Liferay SaaS is the right choice for Clarity.
* The provisioning process to start using Liferay SaaS and its cloud console.
