# Liferay SaaS and Clarity

Clarity can choose from the three deployment options previously mentioned. Some businesses may prefer to have exclusive control over their technology stack or to keep their data on-premises. Others may prefer to leverage SaaS tools to be able to focus on their core business. After a number of years of piecing together different systems and solutions, Clarity is ready to simplify their approach by choosing Liferay SaaS.

At a high level:

* Liferay SaaS is the best solution for Clarity. Some of the benefits are lower cost and overhead, increased security, and greater scalability.

## Lower Cost and Overhead

Clarity will save time and money moving to Liferay SaaS. In the past, Clarity has purchased tools and licenses for various systems to keep their website and operations running. Now with Liferay SaaS they can bring all the tools under one roof. Some ways Liferay SaaS will save Clarity time and money:

* No need for separate cloud infrastructure costs
* No need for specialized personnel to administer a complex infrastructure
* No need for separate licenses (e.g. cloud storage, e-commerce, site security, etc.)

## Increased Security

Clarity knows how vital security is, but as a B2B commerce business, they have limited manpower to stay on top of their data security. With increasing cybersecurity threats, moving to Liferay SaaS is the right choice:

* Enterprise-grade firewall and network defense of the cloud infrastructure
* No need for an in-house security team, data is protected for you
* No need to patch and maintain security updates across your different systems
  
## Greater Scalability

Rapid growth has been great for Clarity's bottom line, but it has also meant scaling challenges for its infrastructure. Despite making some performance improvements, the IT team still has serious concerns as Clarity continues to grow. They are eager to reap the benefits of the scalability of Liferay SaaS:

* Performance scaling to handle peak loads
* 99.80 percent uptime
* 24/7 monitoring and on-going health checks
