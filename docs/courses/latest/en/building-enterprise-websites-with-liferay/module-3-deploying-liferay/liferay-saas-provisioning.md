# Liferay SaaS Provisioning

After signing up, a new Liferay SaaS account is provisioned for Clarity. An email invitation is sent for the new Liferay DXP instance, as well as an invitation to the Liferay cloud console. 

At a high level:

* New Liferay SaaS accounts are provisioned for immediate use. Log in to Liferay and begin building. Log in to the cloud console to monitor the environment.

After login, Clarity can immediately start building with Liferay DXP. They can begin [navigating Liferay](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/getting-started/navigating-dxp) and start building for their business.
