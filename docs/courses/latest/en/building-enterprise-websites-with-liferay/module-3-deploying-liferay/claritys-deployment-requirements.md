# Clarity's Deployment Requirements

Coming soon!

<!-- Before we talk about the different ways Liferay can be deployed, let's look a little closer at some of the specific requirements Clarity has around deployment.

### Clarity wants to reduce the need for multiple IT systems for their website.

Along with a full suite of site building tools, Liferay also comes with a content management system, commerce capabilities, search capabilities, site analytics, and so much more. Having all these solutions bundled together means no longer having to pay for separate systems and various licenses. Clarity can deploy and maintain just one system to replace multiple systems.

### As much as possible, Clarity wants the website building and maintenance to be able to be done by non-technical team members.

Almost all of the site building Clarity wants to do can be done right from the UI (as we will see in the following modules). No coding or technical background is needed. Other tasks, such as user management, analytics, and commerce use cases can also be done from the UI. This means Clarity no longer needs specialized personnel to administer the infrastructure, and more team members can help participate in website building and maintenance.

### Clarity has specific plans to build out their website in the coming years to handle more customers. They require a solution that can grow with them.

Liferay is ready to scale with you whether you plan to have thousands of employees using the system or thousands of visitors navigating your websites. Clarity mostly serves other businesses for now, but in the future, Liferay can grow with them to also support an e-commerce store to serve consumers. Spinning up new websites on a Liferay instance can be done with just a few clicks. Auto-scaling and node clustering can be configured to handle high volumes of site traffic. 

Now let's move on to the different offerings from Liferay and Clarity's decision-making process. -->
