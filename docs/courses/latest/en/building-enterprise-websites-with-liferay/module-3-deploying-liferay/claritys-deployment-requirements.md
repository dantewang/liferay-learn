# Clarity's Deployment Requirements

The deployment requirements for software can vary greatly from one organization to another. For example, some organizations may require their data and infrastructure to stay in-house to meet regulatory requirements. Other organizations might put speed and scalability as their highest deployment priority. These requirements are often driven by the business needs of a given company.

## Requirements

With this in mind, let's look at Clarity's business needs and the specific requirements they have around deployment.

### Clarity wants to reduce the need for multiple IT systems for their website.

Along with a full suite of site building tools, Liferay also comes with a content management system, commerce capabilities, search capabilities, site analytics, and so much more. Having all these solutions bundled together means no longer having to pay for separate systems and various licenses. Clarity can deploy and maintain just one system to replace multiple systems.

### As much as possible, Clarity wants the website building and maintenance to accessible by non-technical team members.

Almost all of the site building Clarity wants to do can be accomplished from the UI (as we will see in the following modules). No coding or technical background is needed. Other tasks, such as user management, analytics, and commerce use cases can also be done from the UI. This means Clarity no longer needs specialized personnel to administer their infrastructure. More team members can participate in building and maintaining their website.

### Clarity has specific plans to build out their website in the coming years to handle more customers. They require a solution that can grow with them.

Liferay is ready to scale whether a company grows to thousands of employees using the platform or thousands of visitors navigating its websites. Clarity mostly serves other businesses for now, but in the future, Liferay can grow with them to support an e-commerce store to serve consumers. Spinning up new websites on a Liferay instance can be done with just a few clicks. Auto-scaling and node clustering can also be configured to handle high volumes of site traffic. 

## Conclusion

Now let's move on to the different offerings from Liferay and Clarity's decision-making process.
