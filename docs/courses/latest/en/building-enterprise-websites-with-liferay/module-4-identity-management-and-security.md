Identity Management (IdM) involves processes and technologies for ensuring only the right people have access to the right systems and resources. It encompasses the creation, maintenance, and control of user identities across various systems and applications. By verifying who users are (authentication) and determining what they're allowed to access (authorization), IdM safeguards sensitive information and ensures only authorized individuals can perform specific actions. A comprehensive IdM strategy strengthens security, simplifies user access management, and helps organizations comply with data privacy regulations.

As such, identity management plays an important role in any enterprise solution, even Clarity's enterprise website. This may seem counterintuitive because the site's main audience primarily consists of anonymous users browsing public pages. However, Clarity needs a small team of employees who can log into the system to create and maintain their content. Also, since the website is intended to convert visitors to distributors, they'll need a way for interested visitors to create accounts so that they can have a more personalized experience.

!!! note "Authentication and Authorization"
    Authentication determines whether and how a user can log into a system, while authorization is more about how to limit access to assets like sites, pages, content, images, documents, and so on.

When we talk about identity management with Liferay, weâ€™re talking about providing users with the ability to authenticate to the portal and access protected systems and resources. Single Sign-On (SSO) is a complementary topic in which users who are authenticated can access multiple systems or resources with the same set of credentials.

For the scope of this course, we won't cover every possible identity management scenario. Instead, this module focuses on key decision points that are applicable to other solutions and scenarios.

After completing this module, you will know how to

* Configure an integration using Okta as SSO and IdM.
* Distinguish the authentication experience for Clarity's employees, business partners, and guest users.
* Manually create users, user groups, and roles in Liferay DXP.
* Streamline role management with user groups.
* Assign granular permissions to roles to ensure appropriate access to Liferay applications and resources.
