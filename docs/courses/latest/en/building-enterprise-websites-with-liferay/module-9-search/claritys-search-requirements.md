# Clarity's Search Requirements

As modern businesses generate and store vasts amount of data, the need is ever greater to have tools that can be used to quickly and effectively search and retrieve this data. Having effective search tools means empowering employees and other site visitors, to be productive and reduce wasted time looking for information.

## Requirements

Clarity already has various content on their site such as eyewear products, blog posts, web content, etc. As their business continue to grow, they want to be assured that Liferay's search capabilities can scale with them.

### Configurable search pages for non-technical team members

Clarity needs a solution that is easy to use to quickly create and manage search pages. Liferay provides different search widgets including various search facet widgets out-of-the-box. This means creating search pages is as easy as dragging and dropping different widgets onto a site page. Even custom facets are available without any programming or custom code. This empowers Clarity team members to create the search pages they need without specialized IT help.

### Search that is customizable and extensible

Clarity does not want to relive the challenges they had with their legacy systems and querying data. As the amount of their data grows, Clarity wants a search solution that is fast and accurate and is also capable of integrating with other systems. On top of its already robust search tools, Liferay's search blueprints give the possibility for further search customization thereby future proofing Clarity's search needs. Liferay's headless APIs also provide the potential for integration with third-party services and the option to use Liferay as a headless content management system.
