# Clarity's Search Requirements

As modern businesses generate and store vasts amount of data, the need is ever greater to have tools that can be used to quickly and effectively search and retrieve this data. Having effective search tools means empowering employees and other site visitors, to be productive and reduce time looking for information.

## Requirements

Clarity already has various content on their site, such as eyewear products, blog posts, and web content. As their business continues to grow, they want to be assured that Liferay's search capabilities can scale with them.

### Configurable search pages for non-technical team members

Clarity needs a solution that is easy to use to quickly create and manage search pages. Liferay provides different search widgets including various search facet widgets out-of-the-box. This means creating search pages is as easy as dragging and dropping different widgets onto a site page. Even custom facets are available without any programming or custom code. This empowers Clarity team members to create the search pages they need without specialized IT help.

### Search that is customizable and extensible

Clarity does not want to relive the challenges they had with their legacy systems and querying data. As the amount of their data grows, Clarity wants a search solution that is fast and accurate and is also capable of integrating with other systems. On top of its already robust search tools, Liferay's search blueprints give the possibility for further search customization thereby future proofing Clarity's search needs. Liferay's headless APIs also provide the potential for integration with third-party services and the option to use Liferay as a headless content management system.

<!--Consider whether any of these requirements from the slides should be included:

Provide a self-service platform for customers to find the resources they need: Clarity Vision Solutions understands the importance of search and they want to ensure that their business users can easily create the search experiences that they are looking for. They also know that by creating effective search experiences, they allow their customers and business partners to self-serve and get the answers they need without having to pick up the phone and contact a customer service representative.

Enable searching content stored in legacy systems that may not be readily accessible: Not all of Clarity's data that needs to be searched exists in Liferay. Clarity Vision Solutions has many legacy systems that still contain very valuable information and those systems are not exposed to customers and business partners. Implementing this is beyond the scope of this training, but it’s important to understand that this is possible with Liferay.

Deliver personalized search results based on user roles, departments, or previous search history: Clarity knows that just like content itself, search results are better when they are personalized and they would like the ability to customize search results based on the user that’s performing the search or other factors. 

Users can refine their searches with filters, facets, and keyword operators: Clarity knows that the initial results that get returned will often need to be further refined and they want to make sure that they provide their end users with tools that make it easy to filter results and drill down until they get the data they are looking for.
