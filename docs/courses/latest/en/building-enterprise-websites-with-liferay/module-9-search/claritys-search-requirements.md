# Clarity's Search Requirements

As modern businesses generate and store vasts amount of data, the need is ever greater to have tools that can be used to quickly and effectively search and retrieve this data. Having effective search tools means empowering employees and other site visitors, to be productive and reduce time looking for information.

## Requirements

Clarity already has various content on their site, such as eyewear products, blog posts, and web content. As their business continues to grow, they want to be assured that Liferay's search capabilities can scale with them.

### Configurable search pages for non-technical team members

Clarity needs a solution that is easy to use to quickly create and manage search pages. Liferay provides different search widgets including various search facet widgets out-of-the-box. This means creating search pages is as easy as dragging and dropping different widgets onto a site page. Even custom facets are available without any programming or custom code. This empowers Clarity team members to create the search pages they need without specialized IT help. Also, adding these elements to a search page ensures that site visitors have the means to further refine search results. Visitors can utilize filters, facets, as well as keyword operators to drill down and find the data they are looking for.

### Search that is customizable and extensible

Clarity does not want to relive the challenges they had with their legacy systems and querying data. As the amount of their data grows, Clarity wants a search solution that is fast and accurate and is also capable of integrating with other systems. On top of its already robust search tools, Liferay's search blueprints give the possibility for further search customization thereby future proofing Clarity's search needs. Liferay's headless APIs also provide the potential for integration with third-party services and the option to use Liferay as a headless content management system.

### Enabling a Self-service Platform

Clarity understands the importance of search and making sure their customers and business partners get the answers they need without having to pick up the phone or contact customer service. As Clarity continues to expand their website, in addition to products and blog posts, they plan to add product documentation, manuals, troubleshooting guides, etc. Fortunately Liferay search can search across a wide variety of assets, including document files and PDFs. The data or information visitors are looking for is just a search click away.

### Enable Searching Content Stored in Other Systems

Not all of Clarity's data that needs to be searched exists in Liferay. Clarity has different legacy systems that still contain valuable data that they may want customers or business partners to be able to access. By default, Liferay Search works in conjunction with Liferay's indexing framework. However, it is possible to configure Liferay Search to search different search indexes through the use of low level search. In this way, Clarity has options to still provide search access to other data on legacy systems.

### Deliver Personalized Search Results for Users to see Different Results

Just like the content itself, Clarity knows that search results are better when they are personalized based on the user that performs the search. Liferay's Search Blueprints makes it possible to customize search results based on criteria such as roles, user segments, whether a user is new or is a guest, etc. Personalizing the search results in turn means Clarity can keep users engaged with their content.

## Conclusion

Now that you understand Clarity's search requirements, let's first dive into what Liferay search is and how it works.
