# Clarity's Search Requirements

Modern businesses generate and store vasts amount of data. This makes an effective enterprise search solution essential for efficient knowledge management. Through the strategic implementation of robust search capabilities, you can empower organizations to efficiently access, manage, and leverage their data while optimizing user experience and increasing productivity.

## Requirements

Clarity already has various content on their site, such as products and blog posts. As their business continues to grow, they want to be assured that Liferay's search capabilities can scale with them.

### Configurable search pages for non-technical team members

Clarity needs a solution that is easy to use to quickly create and manage search pages. Liferay provides different search widgets, including various search facet widgets, out-of-the-box. This means creating search pages is as easy as dragging and dropping different widgets onto a site page. Even custom facets are available without any programming or custom code. This empowers Clarity team members to create the search pages they need without specialized IT help. Also, adding these elements to a search page ensures that site visitors have the means to further refine search results. Visitors can then utilize filters, facets, as well as keyword operators to drill down and find the data they are looking for.

### Search that is customizable and extensible

Clarity does not want to relive the challenges they had with their legacy systems and querying data. As their data grows, Clarity wants a search solution that is fast and accurate and is also capable of integrating with other systems. On top of its already robust search tools, Liferay's search blueprints provide extensive search customization. Liferay's headless APIs also provide the potential for integration with third-party services and the option to use Liferay as a headless content management system.

### Enabling a Self-service Platform

Clarity recognizes the need for robust search capabilities to enable effective self-service. As Clarity continues to develop their website, so does their content. With Liferay search, they can empower users to find information independently, whether products,  job listings, blog posts, legal documents, or white papers.

### Enable Searching Content Stored in Other Systems

Not all of Clarity's data that needs to be searched exists in Liferay yet. Clarity has different legacy systems that still contain valuable data that they may want customers or business partners to be able to access. You can configure Liferay search to access external search indexes using low-level search, enabling Clarity to maintain search access to data on their legacy systems.

### Deliver Personalized Search Results for Users to see Different Results

Just like the content itself, Clarity knows that search results are better when they are personalized based on the user that performs the search. Segmentation in Liferay enables different page experiences based on user profiles, while Search Blueprints offer granular control over search results. In the upcoming lessons, we'll delve into how Clarity can leverage these features to deliver highly relevant search results and keep users engaged with their content.

## Conclusion

Now that you understand Clarity's search requirements, let's first dive into what Liferay search is and how it works.
