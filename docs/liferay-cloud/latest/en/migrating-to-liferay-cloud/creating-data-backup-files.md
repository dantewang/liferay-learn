# Stage 2: Creating Data Backup Files

Now that the Liferay versions match between your on-premises and Liferay Cloud environments, you must prepare the data from your installation for migration. This stage of migration involves creating a database dump, migrating the document library store, and compressing the document library into an archive.

```{warning}
The combined size of your database dump and (compressed) document library archive must not exceed 2 TB for you to upload in the next step without contacting Liferay Cloud Support.
```

## Freeze the Data

Before you create your data backup files, you must arrange a window to freeze the data in your Liferay instance. This prevents data from being lost while the backup is being taken. Coordinate with your database administrator to reserve a window to freeze the database and document library for migration.

## Convert the Database to MySQL

```{warning}
Table and column names are treated with case sensitivity in Liferay Cloud. Make sure all of your own references to your database's tables or columns adhere to the same capitalization.
```

Make sure your database is compatible with MySQL 5.7. You can use a tool like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) to convert other database formats to MySQL.

Coordinate with your database administrator before and after the conversion to ensure data integrity. Test the converted database by [connecting it to a local Liferay installation](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/installing-liferay/configuring-a-database.html) before proceeding.

## Create a Database Dump

```{note}
If you are using Windows (OS), then you need file compression software to execute commands to pack/unpack compressed files. Install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or similar file compression software to do this.
```

Now that the database is in MySQL format, run the following commands on your database server. Replace `#` with the database user and password, respectively, and `lportal` with your database name if necessary.

**For Linux and MacOS** (one command):

```bash
mysqldump -u##### -p##### --databases --add-drop-database lportal | gzip -c | cat > database.gz
```

**For Windows** (two commands):

```
mysqldump -u##### -p##### --databases --add-drop-database lportal > database.sql
```

```
7za a -tgzip database.gz database.sql
```

The server creates a compressed database dump file named `database.gz`. 

## Migrate the Document Library to a File System Store

If your document library is using an file storage method that is not a file system store (such as Amazon S3Store or DBStore), then you must migrate to a file system store before proceeding. You can either use the Simple File System Store or Advanced File System Store.

```{important}
The [Advanced File System Store](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/system-administration/file-storage/configuring-file-storage.html) uses a folder structure that more easily scales to large data sets. Migrating to the Advanced File System Store is recommended to accommodate more files in the document library in the long term and is **required** for any production environment.
```

See [File Store Migration](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/system-administration/file-storage/file-store-migration.html) for steps on how to migrate the document library.

### Create a Jenkins Build with the Change

After your local installation of Liferay is migrated, you must also create and deploy a build to your Liferay Cloud environments with the change to `portal-ext.properties`. You do not need to deploy any changes to your environments if you did not need to migrate your document library store.

Run Git commands to submit your changes using any terminal with Git installed.

1. Add the changed files to Git:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

1. Make a commit with your changes and a message:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Liferay Cloud Migration Stage 2"
    ```

1. Push the changes to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

Since your project is linked to the GitHub repository, pushing the changes automatically creates a build. Wait for the build to complete before proceeding.

### Deploy the Build to Your Chosen Environment

Finally, use the [Liferay Cloud Console](https://console.liferay.cloud/) to deploy the completed build to your chosen environment.

1. In the Liferay Cloud Console, go to the Builds page (using the link at the top of the page).

1. Find the build you created previously in the list, and from the Actions menu, click *Deploy build to*.

    ![Use the build's Actions menu to deploy it.](./creating-data-backup-files/images/01.png)

1. Select the environment to deploy the build to (e.g., `acme-dev`).

1. Read the information below and select the confirmation boxes to confirm the results of the deployment.

    ![Check the checkboxes and deploy the build when ready.](./creating-data-backup-files/images/02.png)

1. Click *Deploy Build*.

The build is deployed to your chosen environment, and the change to `portal-ext.properties` is applied when the `liferay` service restarts.

```{important}
All of your environments on Liferay Cloud must use the same implementation for the document library to allow backups from one environment to work if [restored to the others](../platform-services/backup-service/restoring-data-from-a-backup.md). You should deploy the build to all of your environments to make sure they all correctly use the migrated document library store.
```

## Compress the Document Library

On the server with your document library, run the following commands to compress the document library for upload.

**For Linux and MacOS** (two commands):

```bash
cd $LIFERAY_HOME/data
```

```bash
tar -czvf volume.tgz document_library
```

**For Windows** (three commands):

```
cd $LIFERAY_HOME\data
```

```
7za a volume.tar document_library
```

```
7za a volume.tgz volume.tar
```

You now have a compressed document library archive called `volume.tgz`.

## Next Steps

Now you have two files (`database.gz` and `volume.tgz`) ready to apply to a Liferay Cloud environment. Next, you will [upload and restore a data backup](./uploading-and-restoring-the-data-backup.md) using these files.
