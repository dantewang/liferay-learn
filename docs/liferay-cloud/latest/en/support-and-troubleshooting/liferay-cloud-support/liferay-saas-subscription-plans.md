# Liferay SaaS Subscription Plans

Liferay SaaS is capable of running a wide variety of applications that you design while Liferay maintains the infrastructure. Applications that require large amounts of resources may require a different subscription plan to run in Liferay SaaS.

Here are the subscription plans Liferay offers for SaaS to meet various possible needs, and their corresponding resource allocations.
