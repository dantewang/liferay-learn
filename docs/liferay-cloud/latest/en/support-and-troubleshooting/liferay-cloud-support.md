# Liferay Cloud Support

Liferay is committed to providing excellent service and customer experience. Liferay Cloud customers have several means to contact support, including [opening a Support ticket](#opening-a-support-ticket) or [calling the appropriate region's Support office](#liferay-phone-support). Liferay PaaS customers can also use a [live chat with Support](./liferay-cloud-support/live-chat-for-liferay-paas.md) to ask about simple questions or issues.

Subscribe to the [Liferay Cloud Status page](https://status.liferay.cloud/) for real-time updates on the platform's status, including its various services, the console, and API. You can subscribe to updates via email, text message, Slack message, or webhook notifications.
