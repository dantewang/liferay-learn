# Liferay Cloud Support

Liferay is committed to providing excellent service and customer experience. Liferay Cloud customers have several means to contact support, including [opening a Support ticket](#opening-a-support-ticket) or calling the appropriate region's Support office. Liferay PaaS customers can also use a [live chat with Support](./liferay-cloud-support/live-chat-for-liferay-paas.md) to ask about simple questions or issues.

Subscribe to the [Liferay Cloud Status page](https://status.liferay.cloud/) for real-time updates on the platform's status, including its various services, the console, and API. You can subscribe to updates via email, text message, Slack message, or webhook notifications.

    ![Describe the issue you are having in the fields given so that the Support team can appropriately respond to your request.](./liferay-cloud-support/images/03.png)

    When submitting a ticket, please provide information including:

    * The build images currently in use
    * The behavior or question you are facing
    * Steps to reproduce the issue
    * A description of both the actual behavior and the expected behavior

The ticket is created once you submit the form. You will get an email notification once a Support team member has responded to your ticket. You can continue to respond via the [Help Center Requests](https://help.liferay.com/hc/requests) page, or by responding to the email.
