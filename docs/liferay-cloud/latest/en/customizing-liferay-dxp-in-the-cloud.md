# Customizing Liferay DXP in the Cloud

Client extensions are the primary means of extending Liferay. Build your client extensions independently in your own workspace, then deploy them to any Liferay Cloud environments as needed. See the [client extension documentation](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions) for more information.

In Liferay Cloud, the Liferay service is the core of your project. In Liferay PaaS, you can deploy some other kinds of customizations as part of directly managing the service. See [Using the Liferay DXP Service](./customizing-liferay-dxp-in-the-cloud/using-the-liferay-dxp-service.md) to learn more.
