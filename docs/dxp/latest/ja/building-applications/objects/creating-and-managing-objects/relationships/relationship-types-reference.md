<!-- Liferay objects have two kinds of relationships: one-to-many and many-to-many.

## One to Many

Relate one object entry to multiple object entries. This type adds a relationship table to entries on the parent side of the relationship (i.e., the 'one' side) and a relationship field to entries on the child side (i.e., the 'many' side).

## Many to Many

Relate multiple object entries with multiple object entries. This adds a relationship table to entries on both sides of the relationship.
