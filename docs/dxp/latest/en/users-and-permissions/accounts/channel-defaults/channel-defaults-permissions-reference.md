# Channel Defaults Permissions Reference

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 7.4 U75+/GA75+`

Setting channel defaults for an account ensures that addresses, shipping options, terms and conditions, and payment methods are pre-selected for checkout. This can provide a smoother checkout experiences and faster order creation.

Only users with specific permissions can change these defaults at checkout. Users without these permissions do not see the associated checkout steps.
