## Deactivating and Deleting an Account User

Deleting an account user is a two-step process that involves deactivating the user and then deleting it. This is because you may want to deactivate a user and still have time to review its data before deletion (e.g., due to [legal requirements](../managing-user-data.md)).

### Deactivating an Account User

Deactivating prevents the account user from logging in, but preserves the user's data and information.

1. In Account Users, pick a user and click its *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)). 

1. Click *Deactivate* and click *OK* to confirm your change.

The account user is now deactivated.

To see a deactivated user, click the *Filter and Order* drop-down menu and select *Inactive* under Filter by Status. You can click a user's *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and click *Activate* to reactivate it.

### Deleting an Account User

1. In Account Users, click the *Filter and Order* drop-down menu and click *Inactive* under Filter by Status.

1. Click the inactive user's *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Delete*

   ![Select the inactive user and click Delete.](./account-users/images/04.png)

1. Click *OK* on the pop-up form to confirm your decision. The account user is now deleted.

## Impersonating an Account User

You can impersonate account users to view the system as they would see it. This can be used to diagnose permission issues an administrator can't see, such as making sure a user doesn't have access to restricted data. Only users with this permission can impersonate a different user.

1. In Account Users, click the user's *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)).

1. Select *Impersonate User*.

A new window opens with you logged in as the selected account user.
