## Social Tools

The following social applications are included with Liferay DXP:

- [Activities](./collaboration-and-social/social-tools/using-the-activities-widget.md)
- [Contacts Center](./collaboration-and-social/social-tools/using-the-contacts-center-widget.md)

These tools are building blocks for building an integrated, social experience for users. Activities provide a configurable feed of the actions users take on a site. Contacts Center allows users to search, view, and establish social relations with other users.
