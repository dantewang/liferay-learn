# Liferay Software Versions

Starting with Liferay 7.4, Liferay adopted a rolling release model for delivering updates and fixes. This means Liferay 7.4 is a long living release with many releases for the foreseeable future. To indicate versions, Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP use the following scheme:

| Software | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| Liferay Portal | 7.4.3.XX-gaXX |
| Liferay DXP | 7.4.13-uXX |

## Previous Versions

Older Liferay releases follow a specific structure of major, minor, and maintenance releases consisting of a three digit number. For example, 6.1.2. These numbers represent the type of release: major.minor.maintenance.

A change in the first digit (e.g. 6.x.x to 7.x.x) or the second digit (e.g. 7.2.x to 7.3.x) represents a major or minor release. The release might include things such as functionality changes, architectural changes, API changes, or addition of new features.

A change in the third digit (e.g. 6.2.1 to 6.2.2) represents a maintenance release. The release might include things such as security fixes, or reliability improvements.

Patches and fix packs are also available for previous versions. See [Understanding Patch Types](../maintaining-a-liferay-installation/patching-dxp-7-3-and-earlier/understanding-patch-types-for-dxp-7-3-and-earlier.md) to learn more.
