# Upgrading Custom Development

## Upgrading on 7.4

!!! note
    This section is under construction.

If you're upgrading a language key override to 7.4+, follow the [language key override upgrade instructions](./upgrading-custom-development/upgrading-language-key-overrides.md) first.

## Upgrading on 7.3 or Lower

The [Liferay Upgrade Planner](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147451-Liferay-Upgrade-Planner) is the recommended way to upgrade custom development to Liferay versions [7.2](../../liferay-development/liferay-internals/reference/7-2-breaking-changes.md) and [7.3](../../liferay-development/liferay-internals/reference/7-3-breaking-changes.md). It identifies your code that's affected by breaking changes and offers to adapt your code automatically to many of the changes. See [Upgrading Code to Liferay 7.2](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029316391-Introduction-to-Upgrading-Code-to-Liferay-DXP-7-2) for more information.
