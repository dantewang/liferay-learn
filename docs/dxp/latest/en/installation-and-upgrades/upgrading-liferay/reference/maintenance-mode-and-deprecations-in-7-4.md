# Maintenance Mode and Deprecations in 7.4

With each new Liferay DXP and Liferay Portal release, a feature may not warrant continued enhancements or may become obsolete. Stopping enhancements for a feature puts it in *Maintenance Mode*.

**Maintenance Mode:** Supported features with no further enhancements planned

Obsolete features are eventually removed or replaced with newer, improved features. Before dropping support for an obsolete feature, Liferay marks it as *Deprecated*.

**Deprecated:** Unsupported from the next minor version release

!!! important
    You should plan to stop using deprecated features because their support may cease as early as the next minor release. See [Maintenance Mode and Deprecation Policies](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015767952-Maintenance-Mode-and-Deprecation) for details.

## Deprecated Feature Availability

Deprecated features have different availability:

**Bundled:** Liferay includes the feature.

**Marketplace:** The feature is included in a Marketplace app's final version.

**Final:** The final version of the Marketplace app is released for this Liferay version.

**Archived:** The feature is unavailable, but its code is available in a sources artifact on Liferay's repository at <https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/index.html#welcome>.

**Removed:** The feature and its code are unavailable.
