# Updating Liferay

{bdg-secondary}`For Liferay DXP 7.3 SP3+ and 7.4 GA1+`

Update your Liferay installation with Bundle Releases. The latest features, security releases, as well as library updates are all delivered together in one bundle. See [Updating Previous Versions of Liferay](./updating-previous-versions-of-liferay.md) for versions before Liferay.

```{warning}
**Always** [back up](./backing-up.md) your database and installation before updating Liferay DXP/Portal.
```

As your prepare for a new update, identify the important dependencies of your Liferay installation. This can include things such as your database, document library, and custom modules. Other files such as portal properties, OSGi configurations, Tomcat files, and database jars are also important. See [Important Files to Consider](#important-files-to-consider).

By default, the Liferay Home directory is inside the bundle. To make updating easier, move your Liferay home directory outside of the bundle to avoid accidentally overwriting files from a new bundle release.

1. Set your environment variable to a different directory.

   `export LIFERAY_HOME="/your/liferay/directory"`

1. Specify this directory path in your `portal-ext.properties` file.

   `liferay.home=/your/liferay/directory`

1. Setting the path above also sets Liferay's OSGi folder path to your dependencies. For Marketplace to work, it must point back to the bundle.

   `module.framework.marketplace.dir=/new_liferay_bundle/osgi/marketplace`

1. Save your `portal-ext.properties` file. 

## Configuration Management

Save your important dependencies and files before updating to a new bundle release. You can do this using a shell script or Liferay Workspace.

### Using a Shell Script

You can use a simple shell script such as the one below to back up all dependent Liferay configuration files and libraries. This example uses an array to list out the files that are required when migrating to a new bundle release. 

```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Liferay and Tomcat locations
   LIFERAY_HOME="./liferay"
   CATALINA_HOME="$LIFERAY_HOME/tomcat-9.0.56"

   declare -a persistent_files=(
   "$LIFERAY_HOME/portal-ext.properties"
   "$LIFERAY_HOME/portal-setup-wizard.properties"
   "$LIFERAY_HOME/osgi/configs/com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.cfg"
   "$LIFERAY_HOME/osgi/configs/com.liferay.portal.store.file.system.configuration.AdvancedFileSystemStoreConfiguration.cfg"
   "$LIFERAY_HOME/osgi/configs/com.liferay.portal.search.configuration.IndexStatusManagerConfiguration.cfg"
   "$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml"
   "$CATALINA_HOME/conf/web.xml"
   "$CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh"
   "$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/ehcache-config/"
   "$CATALINA_HOME/lib/ojdbc8.jar"
   "$LIFERAY_HOME/patching-tool/default.properties"
   "$LIFERAY_HOME/osgi/marketplace/override/"
   "$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/"
   "$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/portal-log4j-ext.xml"
   )

   echo "Backing up the following files"
   tar cvfz ./persisted_bundle_configs-`date +%Y%m%d.%H%M`.tgz --files-from <(printf "%s\n" "${persistent_files[@]}")
```

The above script generates a compressed `tar` file you can decompress on top of a newly downloaded bundleâ€™s folder structure.

### Using Liferay Workspace

Liferay Workspace offers configuration management by using environment subfolders inside the `configs` folder. Additionally, there is a `common` folder for any files used in all environments. Note, the path for any configuration file placed inside one of the environment folders must match the path found in the bundle release. For example:

      ../configs/dev/tomcat-9.0.56/conf/server.xml 

See [Creating Deployment Environments](../../building-applications/tooling/liferay-workspace/configuring-liferay-workspace.html#creating-deployment-environments) for more information.

Once your environments are set up, you can use a Gradle task to generate a bundle. Use `distBundleZip` or `distBundleTar` to generate a specific bundle for a defined environment. For example: 

```bash
./gradlew distBundleZip -Pliferay.workspace.environment=dev
```

The Gradle task downloads a new bundle prior to layering the proper configuration files and compiling any modules and themes. 

The resulting bundle(s) are in Liferay Workspace's `build` folder. The version of Liferay DXP in use is defined by the `liferay.workspace.product` property inside the `gradle.properties` file.

To generate bundles for all environments with a single task, use `distBundleZipAll` or `distBundleTarAll`. For example:

```bash
./gradlew distBundleTarAll -Pliferay.workspace.bundle.dist.include.metadata=true
```

Each resulting Zip or Tar's file name includes the name of the config environment and a timestamp. This Gradle task is available in Liferay workspace 3.4.32 and above. 

## Important Files to Consider

Below is a list of common files to consider backing up when moving to a new bundle release. This list is not exhaustive, and your installation may have additional files or libraries that are not mentioned. Additionally, application servers other than Apache Tomcat are not discussed but the principle is the same for maintaining any application server. See [Installing Liferay on an Application Server](../installing-liferay/installing-liferay-on-an-application-server.md).

### Liferay Properties (/LIFERAY/)

* `portal-ext.properties`
* `portal-setup-wizard.properties`

### Liferay OSGI Configurations (/LIFERAY/osgi/configs/)

The OSGI Config directory can potentially contain several configuration files. Below are a few of the common OSGi configuration files to be considered.

* `com.liferay.portal.store.file.system.configuration.AdvancedFileSystemStoreConfiguration.config`
* `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch[6|7].configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config`
* `com.liferay.portal.search.configuration.IndexStatusManagerConfiguration.config`

### Liferay Clustering (LIFERAY/TOMCAT/):

In addition to backing up the jgroups or ehcache configuration file, consider using JDBC Ping with a JNDI pool setting. This can abstract and simplify the ehcache configuration file. This eliminates both IPs and database specific settings from being defined, allowing the file to be almost generic.

* `webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/ehcache-config/tcp.xml`

### Liferay Persisted Logging Settings (LIFERAY/TOMCAT/)

* `webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/portal-log4j-ext.xml`

## Tomcat/Application Server (LIFERAY/TOMCAT/) 

* `conf/server.xml`
* `conf/web.xml`
* `bin/setenv.sh`

### Database Libraries (LIFERAY/TOMCAT/)

It is recommended to use JNDI with Hikari for connecting to the Liferay database. Therefore any required libraries for setting up JNDI connections such as Hikari, MySQL, Oracle, or other database drivers must be backed up.

In 7.4, these drivers are in the LIFERAY/TOMCAT/lib folder. In prior versions, these libraries resided in LIFERAY/TOMCAT/lib/ext.
For example:

* `lib/ojdbc8.jar` for Oracle
* `lib/mysql.jar` for MySQL
* `lib/hikaricp.jar` for Hikari DB Pool 

If you are not using JNDI, see `LIFERAY/TOMCAT/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/shielded-container-lib` in 7.4 or `LIFERAY/TOMCAT/lib/ext` in prior versions for database drivers that you may need to back up. 

### Other Files or Libraries 

You may wish to back up other libraries or files: 

* `lib/xuggler.jar` (`LIFERAY/TOMCAT/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/`) (Deprecated 7.3)
* SAML Keystore (`LIFERAY/data/keystore.jks`)
