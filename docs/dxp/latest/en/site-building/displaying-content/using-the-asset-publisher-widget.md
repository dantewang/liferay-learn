# Using the Asset Publisher Widget

The Asset Display Widget is a powerful tool for [displaying individual pieces of content](./using-the-asset-publisher-widget/displaying-assets-using-the-asset-publisher-widget.md) from various sources like blogs, web content, and documents. You can use it to highlight specific assets on pages, making it ideal for featuring important announcements, articles, or media files.

Users can configure the Asset Publisher Widget to display a chosen asset by [selecting the content type and specific item](./using-the-asset-publisher-widget/displaying-assets-using-the-asset-publisher-widget.md#selecting-assets-in-the-asset-publisher-widget) from a list. The widget supports various content types and offers options to [customize display settings](./using-the-asset-publisher-widget/configuring-asset-publisher-display-settings.md), such as showing metadata or enabling comments, ensuring the content appears as desired.

By using the Asset Display Widget, you can create custom pages that highlight key pieces of content without extensive development, making it a versatile tool for any Liferay-powered site.

Enhance your content display by creating [collections](./collections-and-collection-pages/about-collections-and-collection-pages.md) and setting [experiences](../personalizing-site-experience/experience-personalization/creating-and-managing-experiences.md) aimed at different audiences. This way, you can dynamically change the content displayed in the Asset Publisher Widget based on the experience in place.
