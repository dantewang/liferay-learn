# Mapping Calendar Events to Display Page Templates

With Liferay, you can customize and display calendar event information by mapping calendar fields to [display page templates](../using-display-page-templates.md). Highlight certain fields such as title, date, and location, while hiding others that are less relevant. Additionally, with a [collection display fragment](../collections-and-collection-pages/displaying-collections.md), you can display a dynamically or manually generated collection of calendar events where you can redirect users to the created display page templates.

To map calendar event fields to a display page template,

1. Follow the steps to [create a dynamic collection](../collections-and-collection-pages/creating-collections.md).
