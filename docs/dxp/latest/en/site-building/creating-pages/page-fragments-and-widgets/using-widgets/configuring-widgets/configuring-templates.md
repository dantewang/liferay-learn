# Configuring Templates

Once you've configured a widget, *Configuration Templates* can save those settings in a reusable template.

```{note}
Configuration templates are only available for widgets placed on a page. Applications available from the Liferay DXP Menu do not provide configuration templates.
```

To create a configuration template, 

1. Click *Options* (![Options](../../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) from the menu in the widget's title bar &rarr; select *Configuration Templates*. If you want to save the widget's current settings, click *Save Current Configuration as Template*. Otherwise, modify the settings and then click the button.

1. There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your template and click *Save*. Your configuration now appears in the list. If you must ever revert the app to these archived settings, you can click *Actions* (![Actions](../../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Apply* next to the configuration template you want to apply.

Unless otherwise noted, all widgets in Liferay DXP support this feature. This is particularly useful for widgets with a lot of configuration options, such as the Message Boards application.
