# Setting Widget Permissions

All of Liferay's widgets support Liferay's robust, fine-grained permissions system. Some higher level permissions can be configured in the permissions tab of the widget's configuration dialog box. You can grant Roles permission to

- Add a display template
- Modify the widget's permissions
- Modify the widget's preferences
- Configure the app
- View the widget
- Add the widget to a page

![The permissions matrix makes configuration for a widget convenient.](./setting-widget-permissions/images/01.png)

1. Go to the widget's *Options* icon (![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) and select *Permissions*. This shows you a table of roles.

1. Use the check boxes to grant certain permissions to different roles. Click *Save* after you've made your selections.

```{note}
Some widgets have permissions specific to them. For example, Message Boards contains a *Ban User* permission. This makes no sense in the context of most other widgets. Those permissions are covered with those widgets.
