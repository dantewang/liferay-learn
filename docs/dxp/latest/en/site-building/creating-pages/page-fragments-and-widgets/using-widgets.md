# Using Widgets

Widgets are applications used to build widget pages and can be designed to meet your organization's unique business needs. Built on the Portlet specification, widgets provide a way to create customized web experiences for users. Liferay DXP provides [out-of-the-box widgets](./using-widgets/default-widgets-reference.md) to help you get started, and also offers [Objects](../../../building-applications/objects.md), a Liferay framework used build custom Object definitions that integrate with Liferay frameworks without requiring the writing of code or deployment of modules. With custom object definitions, widgets can be enabled, allowing you to place object definitions directly on widget or content pages.
