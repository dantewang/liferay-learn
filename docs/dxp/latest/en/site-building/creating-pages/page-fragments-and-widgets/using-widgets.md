# Using Widgets

Widgets are full-blown web applications that must be deployed to a Liferay instance. Built on the Portlet specification, widgets provide a way to create customized web experiences for users. Liferay DXP provides out-of-the-box widgets with a lot of functionality, such as [Message Boards](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/collaboration-and-social/message-boards.html), a [Wiki](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/collaboration-and-social/wiki.html), and a host of [others](./using-widgets/default-widgets-reference.md). You can [develop new Java-based widgets of your own](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/building-applications/developing-a-java-web-application.html) or use [Objects](../../../building-applications/objects.md), a Liferay framework for building custom Object definitions that integrate with Liferay frameworks without requiring the writing of code or deployment of modules. With custom object definitions, widgets can be enabled, allowing you to place object definitions directly on widget or content pages.
