# Using Fragments

Page fragments are extensible and reusable drag-and-drop elements for building [content pages](../using-content-pages.md) and their related templates (i.e., [masters](../defining-headers-and-footers/master-page-templates.md), [pages](../adding-pages/creating-a-page-template.md), and [display pages](../../displaying-content/using-display-page-templates.md)). They are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can provide both structure and functionality to your pages.

Liferay provides a variety of fragments out-of-the-box, but you can develop custom fragments using the [page fragment editor interface](../../developer-guide/reference/fragments/page-fragment-editor-interface-reference.md) or the [Fragments Toolkit](../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/using-the-fragments-toolkit.md). Additionally, you can [embed Liferay widgets](../../developer-guide/reference/fragments/fragment-specific-tags-reference.md#including-widgets-within-a-fragment) into fragments or add [editable fields](../../developer-guide/reference/fragments/fragment-specific-tags-reference.md). See [Developing Page Fragments](../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/developing-fragments-intro.md) to learn more.

If you are working with forms, you can personalize your form fields by [mapping them to custom form fragments](./using-fragments/personalizing-custom-forms-using-form-fragments.md).

All page fragments are organized into *sets*, which group related fragments for easier management and use. Each fragment set can include common resources accessible to all the fragments. See [Including Default Resources in Fragments](../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/including-default-resources-with-fragments.md) for more information.

After adding fragments to a page or template, you can configure and customize them and their sub-elements. These options can vary, though some are common to all. See [Configuring Fragments](./using-fragments/configuring-fragments.md) to learn more about available options.
