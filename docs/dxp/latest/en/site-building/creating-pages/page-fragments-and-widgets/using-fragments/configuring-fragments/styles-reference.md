# Styles Reference

Liferay Page Fragments include convenient style settings so you can configure their look and feel via the Liferay UI. Many of these options correspond to CSS classes and have defined tokens supported by Style Books. See [General Settings Reference](./general-settings-reference.md) and [Fragment Sub-Elements Reference](./fragment-sub-elements-reference.md) for additional Fragment configuration options.

Follow these steps to access a Fragment's *Styles* menu:

1. Begin editing a Page or Template that supports Fragments.

1. Open the *Browser* panel (![Browser](../../../../../images/icon-browser.png)) in the sidebar menu and select the desired *Fragment* under Page Elements.

   Alternatively, you can click on the desired Fragment in the Page or Template to open this menu.

   ```{note}
   Sub-elements within a fragment do not have independent style options.
   ```

1. Click the *Styles* tab in the Page Elements side menu.

Many styles have defined tokens supported by Style Books. See [Creating a Style Book](../../../../site-appearance/style-books/using-a-style-book-to-standardize-site-appearance.md) and [Style Book Token Definitions](../../../../site-appearance/style-books/developer-guide/style-book-token-definitions.md) for more information.

```{note}
In Liferay 7.4 versions U31+ and GA31+, all styles can be independently configured per type of device (using the device buttons at the top of the screen, or [Adaptive Media](../../../../../content-authoring-and-management/documents-and-media/publishing-and-sharing/serving-device-and-screen-optimized-media/how-adaptive-media-works.md) for background images). In earlier versions, only text and spacing style configurations can be configured differently per device.
```

## Spacing

```{note}
This feature requires Liferay DXP 7.4 U21+ or GA21+. If you are using an older version, see [this section](#liferay-7-4-u20-and-older) instead.
```

Configure the spacing around the Fragment by clicking on the regions surrounding the rectangle in the Spacing section. Click the outer buttons to configure the space between the Fragment's frame and the end of its surrounding context (the *margin* size); this affects margins such as the space between the Fragment's frame and the edge of the page, or the Fragment's Container. Click the inner buttons to configure the space between a Fragment's frame and its content (the *padding* size).

![Click the regions aroud the rectangle in the Spacing section to configure the spacing for the Fragment's margin or padding.](./styles-reference/images/02.png)

When you click one of these regions, a list appears with pre-defined options for how many pixels to set the chosen spacing size to. These sizes come from the numbered *Spacer* fields in the Spacing category when you [create or edit the Style Book](../../../../site-appearance/style-books/using-a-style-book-to-standardize-site-appearance.md#spacing).

```{note}
If the spacing options in your Style Book are defined in units other then pixels (such as `rem`), then they are converted to the equivalent number of pixels when you are selecting them in a Fragment's Styles configuration.
```
