# Using Utility Pages

{bdg-secondary}`7.4 U86+ and GA86+`

Utility pages serve specific operational tasks and actions and are usually essential for users to interact with a website or application effectively. Utility pages can be configured for a site's 500 and 404 error pages. In the future, this capability will expand to include other common pages (e.g. sign-in and terms of use pages).

Liferay provides [out-of-the-box utility pages](#viewing-utility-pages) that are easily customizable. You can also [create utility pages](#creating-a-new-utility-page) from scratch.

## Viewing Utility Pages

You can edit, preview, or copy utility pages.

1. Open the *Site Menu* ( ![Site Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png) ) and navigate to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* &rarr; *Utility Pages* tab.

   The out-of-the-box pages are marked with a `PROVIDED BY LIFERAY` tag.

1. Choose a page and click *Actions* ( ![Actions Icon](../../../images/icon-actions.png) ) to view and select one of the available options (e.g. Edit, Preview, or Make a Copy).

```{tip}
Edit the utility page the same way you would edit a [content page](../using-content-pages/adding-elements-to-content-pages.md).
```

## Creating a New Utility Page

1. Open the *Site Menu* ( ![Site Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png) ) and  navigate to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* &rarr; *Utility Pages* tab.

1. Select *Add* ( ![Actions Menu](../../../images/icon-add.png) ).

1. Choose the type of utility page you want to create.

1. Select *Blank* for an empty content page or choose an available master page template.

1. Name the utility page and click *Save*.

You can edit the newly created utility page the same way you would edit a [content page](../using-content-pages/adding-elements-to-content-pages.md).

## Selecting a Utility Page as Default

To select a new utility page as default, follow these steps:

1. Open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu icon](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and  navigate to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* &rarr; *Utility Pages* tab.

1. Select Actions (![Actions Menu](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the utility page you want to set as default.

1. Select *Mark as Default*.

```{note}
If a site contains no pages, the default 404 error page is shown even if a utility page is applied.
```

## Utility Page Permissions

Utility pages have permissions that govern their use.
