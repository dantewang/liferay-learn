# Using Page Comments

When building Content Pages, you and your team can collaborate using  Liferay's Page Comments feature. While Comments are enabled out-of-the-box in Liferay DXP 7.3+, they are disabled by default in Liferay DXP 7.2. See [Enabling Comments](#enabling-comments) to learn more.

## Adding Page Comments

Follow these steps to add Page Comments:

1. Navigate to a Content Page that includes Page elements (i.e., Fragments or Widgets) and click the *Edit* button (![Edit Button](../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) to begin editing the Page.

1. Open the *Comments* panel (![Comments Icon](../../../images/icon-comments-w.png)) in the sidebar menu and select the desired Fragment or Widget.

   Alternatively, you can select the desired Page element and click its Comments icon. This opens the Comments panel.

   ```{note}
   Comments cannot be added to [Fragment sub-elements](../page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments/configuring-fragments/fragment-sub-elements-reference.md), Containers, or Grids. 
   ```

1. Enter your comment in the side panel and click *Comment*.

After a comment is added, you can *edit* or *delete* the comment via its *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../../images/icon-actions.png)). Users can also add replies to it.

```{note}
Deleting a comment removes all replies to it.
```

## Reviewing Page Comments

Once comments are added to a Page Fragment or Widget, you can review them in the Comments side panel.

When collaborating, you can mark a comment as resolved by clicking on its *Resolve* button (![Resolve Button](../../../images/icon-resolve.png)). By default, resolved comments and their replies are hidden. However, you can view resolved comments by checking *Show Resolved Comments*.

While viewing resolved comments, you can reopen a comment by clicking its green *Resolve* button.

## Enabling Comments

To enable comments for Content Pages, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Control Panel and navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Content and Data* &rarr; *Pages*.

1. Select *Content Page Editor* under the Virtual Instance Scope. Check the *Comments Enabled* checkbox and click the *Save* button.

   ![Navigate to the Content Page Editor and check the Comments Enabled checkbox.](./using-page-comments/images/07.png)

   You should now be able to use Content Page Comments.

```{note}
This enables Content Page Comments for all instances. To control this on an instance-by-instance basis, navigate to the same setting in *Instance Settings* (instead of *System Settings*).
```
