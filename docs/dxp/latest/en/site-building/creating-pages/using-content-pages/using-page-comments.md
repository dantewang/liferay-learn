# Using Page Comments

When building content pages, you and your team can collaborate using Liferay's page comments feature. Comments are enabled out-of-the-box in Liferay DXP 7.3+.

## Adding Page Comments

Follow these steps to add page comments:

1. Navigate to a content page that includes page elements (i.e., fragments or widgets) and click the *Edit* button ( ![Edit Button](../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png) ) to begin editing the page.

1. Open the *Comments* panel ( ![Comments Icon](../../../images/icon-comments-w.png) ) in the sidebar menu and select the desired fragment or widget.

   Alternatively, you can select the desired page element and click its *Comments* icon. This opens the comments panel.

   ```{note}
   Comments cannot be added to [fragment sub-elements](../page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments/configuring-fragments/fragment-sub-elements-reference.md), containers, or grids.
   ```

1. Enter your comment in the side panel and click *Comment*.

After a comment is added, you can edit or delete the comment via its *Actions* button ( ![Actions Button](../../../images/icon-actions.png) ). Users can also add replies to it.

```{note}
Deleting a comment removes all replies to it.
```

## Reviewing Page Comments

Once comments are added to a page fragment or widget, you can review them in the comments side panel.

When collaborating, you can mark a comment as resolved by clicking on its *Resolve* button ( ![Resolve Button](../../../images/icon-resolve.png) ). By default, resolved comments and their replies are hidden. However, you can view resolved comments by checking *Show Resolved Comments*.

While viewing resolved comments, you can reopen a comment by clicking its green *Resolve* button.
