# Adding Elements to Content Pages

After you [create a content page](../adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md), you can add widgets and fragments to define the page's content and structure.

Follow these steps to add elements:

1. Navigate to the desired content page and click the *Edit* button ( ![Edit Button](../../../images/icon-edit.png) ). This opens the [content page editor](./content-page-editor-ui-reference.md).

1. Open the *Fragments and Widgets* ( ![Fragments and Widgets](../../../images/icon-plus.png) ) side panel and drag and drop the desired elements onto the page.

   You can browse the *Fragments* and *Widgets* tabs or use the *Search* field to find a specific element.

1. (Optional) After adding elements, open the *Browser* panel ( ![Browser](../../../images/icon-hierarchy.png) ) to view and manage all elements added to the page. For Liferay 7.4 U37/GA37+, you can drag and drop elements in the Browser panel to reorganize them or double click elements to rename them.

1. Select and configure each page element in the Configuration sidebar. See [Configuring Fragments](../page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments/configuring-fragments.md) for more information.

1. Click *Publish*.

   By default, publishing makes your changes live immediately. However, if you've enabled a custom [workflow](../../../process-automation/workflow/introduction-to-workflow.md) to direct the review and publishing process, clicking Publish initiates your defined procedure.

```{note}
While editing the page, Liferay automatically saves your progress as a draft.
