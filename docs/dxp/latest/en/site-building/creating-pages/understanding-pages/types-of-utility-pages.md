# Types of Utility Pages

Utility pages are content pages you can apply to system-level pages. Liferay comes with three utility pages out-of-the-box and the ability to customize them or add your own.

## Cookies List

The Cookies List is an out-of-the-box utility page that comes with a list of all cookies used by Liferay. This page can be used to show users what data is tracked in order to achieve [GDPR compliance](../../../users-and-permissions/managing-user-data/enabling-gdpr-compliance-for-cookies.md).

By default, the cookies list is divided into four sections:

- Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They do not store any information that could be used to identify users.

- Functional Cookies. These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by Liferay or by third parties for integrated services. If they are turned off, some service may not function properly.

- Performance Cookies. These cookies provide data for [Analytics Cloud](https://learn.liferay.com/w/analytics-cloud/index). All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.

- Personalization Cookies. These cookies may be set by Liferay's advertising partners. If they are turned off, users will experience less targeted advertising.

If your site uses any cookies not listed in the out-of-the-box page, you can add it to the appropriate section by clicking the *Add* icon ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png).
