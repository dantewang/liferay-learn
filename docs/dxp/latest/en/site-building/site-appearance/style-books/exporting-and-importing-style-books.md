## Configuring Export and Import Processes as a LAR File

Liferay provides settings for configuring export and import processes.

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Application | You can choose to export your style bookâ€™s configuration settings. |
| Content | You can select a date range of content that you want to export. Content added to your style book within your specified date range is included in the LAR file. |
| Deletions | You can choose to export individual deletions. This exports delete operations performed for content types to the LAR file. |
| Delete Application Data Before Importing (Import) | When checked, all data created by the application is deleted before the import process. Be careful: other applications may reference this data. This process cannot be undone. If you are unsure, please do an export first. |
| Permissions | You can choose whether to include permissions for your exported content. The permissions assigned for the exported style book are included if you enable the Export Permissions selector. |
| Update Data (Import) | You can decide how to handle the updated data once it is applied to existing content. |
| Authorship of the Content (Import) | You can decide about the authorship of the imported content. |

## Exporting Style Books as a ZIP File

1. Find the style book you want to export and click *Actions* ( ![Actions Icon](../../../images/icon-actions.png) ) &rarr; select *Export*.

    * `style-book.json` contains the name of the style book and the path to `frontend-token-values.json`.

    * `frontend-token-values.json` contains a list of the token values of the style book. Each token references the CSS variable name and the value mapped to it.

    ```json
    {"brandColor1":{"cssVariableMapping":"brand-color-1","value":"#F05321"},"bodyBgColor":{"cssVariableMapping":"body-bg","value":"#FCBA21"},"btnPrimaryBackgroundColor":{"cssVariableMapping":"btn-primary-background-color","value":"#024da1"}}

You can now use your imported style guide.
