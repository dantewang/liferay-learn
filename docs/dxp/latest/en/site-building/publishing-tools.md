Liferay provides two publishing tools for content creation and site building: Publications and Staging. Each tool provides a way to edit sites and content in a working environment without affecting end users. However, they both achieve this using different frameworks that have varying integration with other Liferay features. While Publications is recommended for most use cases, selecting the right publishing tool can depend on your needs. See [Choosing a Publishing Tool](./publishing-tools/choosing-a-publishing-tool.md) for more information.

```{important}
Presently, Liferay's publishing tools do not support [Commerce applications](https://learn.liferay.com/commerce/latest/en/index.html) or [custom Objects](../building-applications/objects.md).
