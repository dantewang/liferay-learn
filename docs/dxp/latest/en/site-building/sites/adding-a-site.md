# Adding a Site

Sites are customizable spaces for building personalized digital experiences. Follow these steps to create a basic site in your Liferay instance:

1. Open the *Global Menu* ( ![Applications Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png) ), go to the *Control Panel* tab, and click *Sites*.

    ![Open the Sites application.](./adding-a-site/images/01.png)

1. Click *Add* ( ![Add Button](../../images/icon-add.png) ).

1. Select a *Site Template*.
    
1. Choose between templates *Provided by Liferay* or [*Custom Site Templates*](./site-templates.md) to populate your new site with pages, content, and configurations.

    Under *Provided by Liferay*, you can choose a *Blank Site* to create a new site without any pages or content.

    ![You can select a template provided by Liferay or a custom site template to populate your new site with pages, content, and configurations.](./adding-a-site/images/02.png)

1. Enter a *Name* for the site.

   ```{note}
   If [Private Pages](../creating-pages/understanding-pages/understanding-pages.md#enabling-private-pages) are enabled for your system, you, you can determine whether all pages inherited from a site template are private.
   ```

1. Click *Add* to begin creating your site.

Once finished, you are redirected to your new [site's settings](../site-settings/site-settings-ui-reference.md). You can begin configuring your site, or see [Default Site Applications](./default-site-applications.md) for a full list of applications you can use to build your site.

## Creating Organization Sites

Liferay [organizations](../../users-and-permissions/organizations/understanding-organizations.md) enable distributed user management, providing a convenient way to organize and manage instance users and roles to reflect your organizational hierarchy. Once an organization is created, you can also enable a dedicated site for your organization to facilitate distributed portal administration. This feature is available for both parent and child organizations, so you can quickly create a hierarchy of sites with content created, administered, and tailored specifically to each group's needs. See [Organization Sites](../../users-and-permissions/organizations/organization-sites.md) for more information.

```{note}
You can only use the blank template or custom templates when creating an organization site. You cannot use other default templates.
```

## Creating Group Sites

Liferay [user groups](../../users-and-permissions/user-groups/creating-and-managing-user-groups.md) are lists of users that can span multiple organizations and sites. If desired, you can create dedicated sites for user groups to add pages to the [personal site](./personal-sites.md) of each group member. See [User Group Sites](../../users-and-permissions/user-groups/user-group-sites.md) for more information.
