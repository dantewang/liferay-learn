Being a member of a site grants users access and abilities beyond an unauthenticated guest user. These key benefits come with site membership:

* Site members have more permissions than guests for many widgets like message boards and wikis that enable them to create content and collaborate on your site.
* Site members can be associated with roles that grant site privileges.

Site roles are created at a global level, but when they're assigned they only provide permissions for the specific site where they were assigned. Since roles are created at a global level, they can't be created by site administrators (since site administrators only have administrator privileges for their sites). Teams, however, let site administrators assign permissions to groups of users within their sites. See [Creating Teams](./site-membership/creating-teams-for-sites.md) for more information.
