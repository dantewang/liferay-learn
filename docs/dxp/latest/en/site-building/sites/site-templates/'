# Configuring Site Template Propagation

{bdg-secondary}`Available for Liferay 7.4 U23+/GA23+`

You can trigger simultaneous site template propagation to all connected sites manually. By default, Liferay only propagates the template to a connected site when it's first visited by a user after the template is updated. To manually trigger propagation to all connected sites immediately, enable the Trigger Propagation setting. Once enabled, clicking the [Ready for Propagation](./propagating-template-changes.md#enabling-and-disabling-propagation) button in the site template editor triggers propagation to all connected sites.

```{tip}
The propagation trigger is linked to the Ready for Propagation button. If template propagation is already enabled and you'd like to trigger an immediate propagation to all sites at once, you must first click Disable Propagation, then enable again it to trigger the propagation.
```

```{important}
Automatic propagation can be resource intensive, depending the scope of changes made to a template.
```

To configure Site Template propagation,

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), go to the *Control Panel* tab, and click *System Settings*.

1. Go to *Infrastructure* settings and click *Site Templates* under Virtual Instance Scope in the side menu.

1. Check *Trigger Propagation*.

   If unchecked, changes are propagated to sites individually when they’re first visited by a user.

   If checked, enabling automatic propagation in a template also triggers propagation for all connected sites simultaneously.

1. Click *Save*.

If propagation is disabled for a Site Template, enabling propagation immediately begins propagating changes to connected Sites simultaneously. While propagation remains enabled for the template, subsequent changes are propagated to sites individually when they’re first visited by a user.
