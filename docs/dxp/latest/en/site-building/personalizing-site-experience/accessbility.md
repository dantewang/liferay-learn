# Accessibility

Liferay is becoming more accessible, and most enhancements to accessibility are propagated across the entire platform by default. However, certain behaviors are better decided by the individual browsing the site. Beginning in Liferay DXP 2024.Q2/Portal 7.4 GA120, these settings are available for you to enable, if desired. See [Using the Accessibility Menu](./using-the-accessibility-menu.md) for details.
