# Intercom

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is a customer service solution with a help desk AI Chatbot. Here's how to find your Intercom account ID.

You can find your account ID by looking at the URL. Your account ID is between `/apps` and `/home` in the URL. If the URL is `https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/abcdefg1/home`, after `/apps` the sequence of letters and numbers is your ID. In this example, Intercom's Account ID is `abcdefg1`.
