# Including Default Resources in Fragments

You can include images (e.g. `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`) in your Fragment Sets for your Fragments to use. Keeping images with your Fragments, rather than in other applications, like [Documents and Media](../../../content-authoring-and-management/documents-and-media.md), is a convenience. Here you'll learn how to include image resources in your Fragment Sets and use image resources in your Fragments.

```{note}
For Liferay DXP 7.4+, Fragment Collections are called Fragment Sets in the Liferay UI.
```

## Import a Fragment Set with Resources

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Then, follow these steps to import an example Fragment Set to see how Fragment resources work:

1. Download and unzip the [example resources Fragment Set](https://resources.learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/site-building/developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/liferay-i6r3.zip):

    ```bash
    curl https://resources.learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/site-building/developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/liferay-i6r3.zip -O
    ```

    ```bash
    unzip liferay-i6r3.zip
    ```

1. Setup up the Fragments Toolkit:

    ```bash
    cd liferay-i6r3
    ```

    ```bash
    ./setup_tutorial.sh
    ```

    Resolve all unmet requirements reported by the script and rerun the script until it reports that your environment is ready.

1. Import the Fragment Set in the Docker container with the Fragments Toolkit using the `yarn run import` command below.

    ```bash
    yarn run import

    ...
    ? Liferay host & port http://localhost:8080
    ? Username test@liferay.com
    ? Password [hidden]

    Checking connection...
    Connection successful

    ? Company ID liferay.com
    ? Group ID Liferay DXP

    Building project...
    Importing project...

    âœ” Fragment I6R3 Card imported

    Project Imported
    ```

1. Verify that the Fragment Set is available. Point your browser to `https://localhost:8080`, and under the Site Menu on the left side of the screen, go to *Design* &rarr; *Fragments*. The I6R3 Set should appear with the other Fragment Sets.

1. Click on the *I6R3 Set*.

1. Click the *Resources* tab. The `books.png` image appears in the resource list.

    ![The resource is available in the Fragment Set.](./including-default-resources-with-fragments/images/01.png)

## Fragment Set Structure with Resources

Fragment Sets with resources use the following structure:

* `collection.json`: a text file which describes your Set with the format `{"name":"Set Name","description":"Set description"}`.
* `[fragment-name]/`: contains all of a Fragment's files.
* `resources/`: contains files available to all the Set's Fragments.

```{tip}
Alternatively, you can upload the image through the *Resources* tab in the [Fragments Editor](./using-the-fragments-editor.md).
```

Image files are referenced in a Fragment's HTML with the syntax `[resources:image-name.extension]`. The example Fragment HTML has this `img` element:

```html
<img
    class="card-img-top"
    src="[resources:books.png]"
/>
```

![Embed image resources in fragments.](./including-default-resources-with-fragments/images/02.png)

```{note}
The resource name is case-sensitive and must match the name and case exactly in the reference.
```

```{tip}
You can style the image resource in your CSS with the syntax `img[src="[resources:image-name.extension]"]`.
```

## Include a New Resource

Now that you know how to include a resource and reference it in a Fragment, you can use a new resource in the example Fragment Set.

1. Copy an image, such as an image from <https://www.freeimages.com/>, to the `liferay-i6r3.zip/src/i6r3-set/resources/` folder.

1. Import the Fragment Set in the Docker container again as you did above:

    ```bash
    yarn run import
    ```

1. Verify that the Fragment Set includes the resource. In the *Fragments* page in the UI, select the *I6R3 Set* and click the *Resources* tab. The new image should appear in the resource listing.

    ![Verify the new image appears in the Set's resource list.](./including-default-resources-with-fragments/images/03.png)

1. Open the *I6R3 Card* Fragment by selecting the Set's *Fragments* tab and clicking the *I6R3 Card* Fragment. The Fragment source appears in the Fragments Editor.

1. Update the Fragment to use the new image resource. Delete `books.png` from the `img` element's `src="[resources:books.png]"` attribute and start typing the new image file's name after `src="[resources:`. An attribute value with the image file name appears under the cursor. Select that attribute value.

    ![The Fragments Editor lists the matching resources.](./including-default-resources-with-fragments/images/04.png)

1. Verify that the Fragment renders the new image.

    ![The Fragment should use the new resource image.](./including-default-resources-with-fragments/images/05.png)

```{note}
Any Fragment in a Fragment Set has access to the Set's resources.
```

Great! Now you know how to use image resources Fragment Sets.
