# Using the Simulation Panel

{bdg-secondary}`Available Liferay DXP 2023.Q4+/Portal GA104+`

You can verify your page's responsiveness by simulating different scenarios.

With Liferay, use the Simulation panel to simulate different [screen sizes](#simulation-panel-screen-size) and combine it with [page content](#simulation-panel-page-content) directed at available [segments](../../personalizing-site-experience/segmentation/creating-and-managing-user-segments.md) or with different [experiences](../../personalizing-site-experience/experience-personalization/creating-and-managing-experiences.md) applied to the page.

## Accessing the Simulation Panel

The Simulation panel (![Simulation panel](../../../images/icon-simulation.png)) is in the application bar.

![The Simulation panel is located in the application bar.](./using-the-simulation-panel/images/01.png)

Access the page using its address or through the Pages application to use the Simulation panel. To view a page through the Pages application:

1. Open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and navigate to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

1. Find the page you want to view and click *Actions* (![Actions icon](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *View*.

```{important}
You need the Preview in Device permission to use the Simulation panel. It's located under Control Panel &rarr; Sites &rarr; Sites &rarr; Resource Permissions &rarr; Site. See [Defining Role Permissions](../../../users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.md) to learn more about permissions.
```

## Simulation Panel: Screen Size

You have five options when simulating the screen size, three pre-defined values (desktop, tablet, or mobile) and two variable ones (autosize and custom). To simulate the content, click on the *option's* icon.

| Option | Height | Width |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| Desktop (![Desktop icon](../../../images/icon-desktop.png)) | 1050 px  | 1300 px |
| Tablet (![Tablet icon](../../../images/icon-tablet.png)) | 900 px  | 808 px |
| Mobile (![Mobile icon](../../../images/icon-mobile.png)) | 640 px  | 400 px |
| Autosize (![Autosize icon](../../../images/icon-autosize.png)) | Adapts to window* | Adapts to window |
| Custom (![Custom icon](../../../images/icon-custom.png)) | Custom input** | Custom input |

\* The autosize option adapts the simulation to the window's size.

** Enter a custom value to the height and width of the simulated screen.

## Simulation Panel: Page Content

If you have segments or experiences in place, you can also simulate the content based on segment or experience applied.

<!-- Context: Imagine you are creating an intranet site used by different departments in your company.

You want to show different departments, different information. So, you create the Engineers and the QA Engineers segments. Then, you create experiences directed at those segments, customize the page, and show different content to each segment.

With the simulation panel, you can visualize how the experiences and segments look in a simulated screen. - This is probably going to get cut, so I am flagging it already =) Eric M. -->

1. In the first selector, choose *Segments* or *Experiences* under Preview By to see the available segments and experiences in the second selector.

1. If there are availabe segments or experiences, select them in the second selector.

```{note}
A message on top of the simulated content provides information about the applied segment/experience.
```
