Using Service Builder helps you learn it. You'll use it to learn the basics:

1. [Generating Model, Persistence, and Service Code](./service-builder-basics/generating-model-persistence-and-service-code.md): Define a basic model, generate code from it, and deploy the code to DXP. Verify the generated database tables and test the new service on DXP.

1. [Understanding and Extending Generated Classes](./service-builder-basics/understanding-and-extending-generated-classes.md): Extend a base implementation, add a service operation to the API, and understand the process in the context of DXP. It also provides an overview of the classes generated by Service Builder, including extension implementation classes.

1. [Invoking a Service Locally](./service-builder-basics/invoking-a-service-locally.md): Use the service in a portlet application.
