Liferay's developer tools run the gamut from standard build scripting, to lightweight CLI utilities, and all the way to a full-blown IDE based on Eclipse. This is to serve all developers, whether you're just starting out or have been writing code for many years. All of Liferay's development tools work on Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms.
