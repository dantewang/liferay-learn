# Creating a New Job Scheduler Task Executor

Each Job Scheduler Task is created by implementing the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface and can execute any logic. While Liferay DXP provides multiple out-of-the-box executors, you can create your own. Once created and deployed, you can add Job Scheduler Tasks to a Liferay instance.

Follow these steps to create your own implementation of the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface:

1. **OSGI Component**: Declare the module a Component within the OSGi framework using the `@Component` annotation.

1. **Service**: Identify the module as a `DispatchTaskExecutor.class` service within the `@Component` annotation.

1. **OSGi Properties**: Add the following properties to the `@Component` annotation.

   * `dispatch.task.executor.name`: defines the string used for the executor's name in the Job Scheduler UI.

      ```{note}
      If you want your Job Scheduler Task to use localized names, add a language key value for the `dispatch.task.executor.name` property to the moduleâ€™s `resources/content/Language.properties` file.
      ```

   * `dispatch.task.executor.type`: defines a unique `type` value to match the right Job Scheduler Task Executor and Job Scheduler Trigger.

      ```{note}
      Values must be unique to ensure the correct executor matches. If a value is not unique, the log displays an error on startup indicating which executors have the same property value.
      ```

1. [**`DispatchTaskExecutor`**](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/dispatch/dispatch-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/dispatch/executor/DispatchTaskExecutor.java): Implement the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface or extend an implementation of it (e.g., ``BaseDispatchTaskExecutor``).

      ```{important}
      Implementations of the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface must handle status logs for Job Scheduler tasks, because the framework depends on those logs to control the concurrent execution of tasks.
         
      For your convenience, Liferay provides the `BaseDispatchTaskExecutor` abstract [class](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/dispatch/dispatch-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/dispatch/executor/BaseDispatchTaskExecutor.java) that logs the Job Scheduler task's status as `IN PROGRESS`, `SUCCESSFUL`, or `FAILED`.
      ```

1. **Methods**: If you're implementing the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface directly, override its `execute()` method to implement custom logic. If instead you're extending the ``BaseDispatchTaskExecutor`` abstract class, override its `doExecute()` method.

   ```{note}
   The `getName()` method is deprecated and replaced by the `dispatch.task.executor.name` property.
   ```

   ```{tip}
   You can use the `dispatchTrigger.getDispatchTaskSettings()` method to fetch properties set in the Job Scheduler Task's Settings editor.
   ```

The following sample module demonstrates how to create and deploy a custom Job Scheduler Task Executor to a Liferay instance.

## Deploying the Sample Job Scheduler Task Executor

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Then, follow these steps to download, build, and deploy the sample Job Scheduler Task Executor to the new Docker container:

1. Download and unzip the example module.

   ```bash
   curl https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/building-applications/core-frameworks/job-scheduler-framework/liferay-s7a3.zip -O
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip liferay-s7a3.zip
   ```

1. Run this `gradlew` command to build the JAR file and deploy it to your new Docker container:

   ```bash
   cd liferay-s7a3
   ```

   ```bash
   ./gradlew deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
   ```

   The JAR is generated in the `build/libs` folder (i.e., `s7a3-impl/build/libs/com.acme.s7a3.impl-1.0.0`).

1. Confirm the module was successfully deployed and started via the container console.

   ```log
   Processing com.acme.s7a3.impl-1.0.0.jar
   STARTED com.acme.s7a3.impl-1.0.0 [1656]
   ```

1. Verify the module is working by using it to [add a new Job Scheduler Task](./using-job-scheduler.md#adding-a-new-job-scheduler-task) to your Liferay instance.

   ![Add a new Job Scheduler Task using the new template.](./creating-a-new-job-scheduler-task-executor/images/01.png)

   Once you've created the task, click on *Run Now*.

   ![Click Run Now for your new Job Scheduler Task.](./creating-a-new-job-scheduler-task-executor/images/02.png)

   If successful, it should print the following message to the console when executed.

   ```log
   INFO [liferay/dispatch/executor-2][S7A3DispatchTaskExecutor:30] Invoking #doExecute(DispatchTrigger, DispatchTaskExecutorOutput)
   ```

   You can also click the task and go to the *Logs* tab to see a list of all previous runs.

## Code for the Sample Job Scheduler Task Executor

```{literalinclude} creating-a-new-job-scheduler-task-executor/resources/liferay-s7a3.zip/s7a3-impl/src/main/java/com/acme/s7a3/internal/dispatch/executor/S7A3DispatchTaskExecutor.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 15-44
```

The module is declared an OSGi `@Component` and defines two properties: `dispatch.task.executor.name` and `dispatch.task.executor.type`. It then identifies the module as a `DispatchTaskExecutor.class` service.

Following the `@Component` annotation, the module extends the `BaseDispatchTaskExecutor` abstract class and overrides the `doExecute` method. This method uses the `LogFactoryUtil` to display an INFO message in the console's logs.
