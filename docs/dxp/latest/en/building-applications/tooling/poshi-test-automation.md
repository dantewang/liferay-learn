Poshi is a test automation framework that is simple, easy to understand, and does not require prior development experience to get started. Poshi tests can be written to simulate a user's behavior as they navigate through a site. Poshi uses a Groovy-like script syntax built on top of [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/), one of the most popular open source tools for browser automation.
