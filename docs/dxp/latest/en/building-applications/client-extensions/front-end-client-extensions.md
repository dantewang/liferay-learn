{bdg-secondary}`Available Liferay 7.4 U45+/GA45+`

Liferay provides a variety of front-end client extensions for augmenting your pages and integrating functionality. These extension types include CSS, JS, theme CSS, theme JS, theme favicon, custom element, and IFrame.

You can create and deploy these extensions from your [Liferay Workspace](../tooling/liferay-workspace/what-is-liferay-workspace.md). 

See [Understanding Custom Element and IFrame Client Extensions](./front-end-client-extensions/understanding-custom-element-and-iframe-client-extensions.md) to learn more about creating [custom element](#custom-element-client-extensions) and [IFrame](#iframe-client-extensions) client extensions.

```{note}
You can add JS, CSS, or Theme CSS client extensions to layout sets (i.e., page sets), master templates, page templates, and individual content pages. The level at which you add the extension determines which entities inherit the extension's code. For example, if you add extensions to a master template, all page templates and content pages using the master template inherit its extensions.
```

## JavaScript Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

You can use JavaScript client extensions to provide global JavaScript libraries and logic throughout your Liferay instance (or virtual instance). When you deploy a JavaScript client extension to your Liferay instance and configure a page to use it, the JavaScript contained in it automatically runs each time you visit the page. This allows you to add special functionality to your pages without the use of an OSGi module or theme.

Use this `type` value in your `client-extension.yaml` file to specify a JavaScript client extension:

```yaml
type: globalJS
```

See [Creating Your First JavaScript Client Extension](./front-end-client-extensions/tutorials/creating-your-first-javascript-client-extension.md) to get started working with this type.

## CSS Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

CSS client extensions are a way to introduce new CSS styling to your pages. When you deploy a CSS client extension to your Liferay instance and configure a page to use it, the CSS contained in it adds to the styling present on the page, including theme and style book settings. 

Use this `type` value in your `client-extension.yaml` file to specify a CSS client extension:

```yaml
type: globalCSS
```

See [Creating Your First CSS Client Extension](./front-end-client-extensions/tutorials/creating-your-first-css-client-extension.md) to get started working with this type.

## Theme JavaScript Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

Similarly to [JavaScript client extensions](#javascript-client-extensions), you can also add JavaScript libraries and logic to your Liferay instance the same way you would with a [theme](../../site-building/site-appearance/themes/introduction-to-themes.md), without deploying an entire theme. For this type of client extension, you use a `theme.js` file, which is the same JavaScript file generated by a theme by default.

Use this `type` value in your `client-extension.yaml` file to specify a theme CSS client extension:

```yaml
type: themeJS
```

## Theme CSS Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

Similarly to [CSS client extensions](#css-client-extensions), you can also add CSS the same way as you would with a [theme](../../site-building/site-appearance/themes/introduction-to-themes.md), without deploying an entire theme. For this type of client extension, you use a `clay.css` file and a `main.css` file, which are the same style files generated by a theme by default. You can add this type of client extension as an option from *Remote Apps* in the Liferay Applications menu.

![Add a theme CSS client extension to apply CSS to your pages the same way as you would with a theme, without the rest of the theme itself.](./front-end-client-extensions/images/01.png)

```{note}
The `clay.css` and `main.css` files must be hosted remotely to use this type of client extension.
```

Use this `type` value in your `client-extension.yaml` file to specify a theme CSS client extension:

```yaml
type: themeCSS
```

## Theme Favicon Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

You can also use client extensions to override the favicon for your pages in Liferay. When you deploy a theme favicon client extension, the icon file included with it becomes available for any page in Liferay. You can access it in a separate *Client Extensions* tab when you configure the favicon for a page from the Page Design Options menu.

![When you configure the favicon for a page, access the favicon from your client extension from a special Client Extensions tab.](./front-end-client-extensions/images/02.png)

## Theme Sprite Map Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

You can use theme sprite map client extensions to override the sprite map for your site's pages in Liferay. Define the sprite map as a `.svg` image. The sprite map replaces the one used by your site's current theme.

Use this `type` value in your `client-extension.yaml` file to specify a theme sprite map client extension:

```yaml
type: themeSpritemap
```

## Custom Element Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

> Previously named Custom Element Remote Apps

Custom element client extensions use Liferay's front-end infrastructure to integrate external applications with the platform and render them as page widgets. They can integrate applications from any domain accessible outside of Liferay.

To use custom element client extensions, you create entries at the company level with the necessary URLs and details to register them with Liferay. Liferay then generates a unique widget for each entry and renders the application as a [custom HTML element](https://web.dev/custom-elements-v1/).

Use this `type` value in your `client-extension.yaml` file to specify a custom element client extension:

```yaml
type: customElement
```

See [Understanding Custom Element and IFrame Client Extensions](./front-end-client-extensions/understanding-custom-element-and-iframe-client-extensions.md) for more information.

## IFrame Client Extensions

> Available for Liferay Experience Cloud and Liferay DXP 7.4+ (on-premises)

> Previously named IFrame Remote Apps

IFrame client extensions work similarly to [custom element client extensions](#custom-element-client-extensions). However, they render external applications as `<iframe>` HTML elements, which allow for limited interaction from the host page.

Use this `type` value in your `client-extension.yaml` file to specify an iframe client extension:

```yaml
type: iframe
```

See [Understanding Custom Element and IFrame Client Extensions](./front-end-client-extensions/understanding-custom-element-and-iframe-client-extensions.md) for more information.

## Front-end Client Extension Properties

These properties are usable within the client extension definition for any type of front-end client extension (in your `client-extension.yaml` file):

| Name | Data Type | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `type` | String | | The specific type of client extension. *Used for all client extension types.* |
| `dxp.lxc.liferay.com.virtualInstanceId` | String | | The virtual instance ID (`webId`) this client extension targets when it is deployed. *Used for all client extension types.* |
| `baseURL` | String | *Derived from site URL* | The base path from which all of the client extension's defined resources are served. |
| `description` | String | | The client extension's description. |
| `name` | String | | The client extension's name (as it appears in the UI). Required for front-end client extensions. |
| `sourceCodeURL` | URL | https://www.liferay.com | The address to the client extension's source repository. |
| `typeSettings` | String[] | [] | A list of strings that are processed with Liferay's `UnicodeProperties` syntax. Type-specific client extension properties are automatically copied into this when the client extension is built. |
