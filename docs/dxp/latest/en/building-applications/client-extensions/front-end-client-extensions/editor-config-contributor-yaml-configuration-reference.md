# Editor Config Contributor YAML Configuration Reference

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q1+/Portal 7.4 GA112+`

!!! important
    This feature is currently behind a release feature flag (LPS-186870). Read [Release Feature Flags](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#release-feature-flags) for more information.

You can define an Editor Config Contributor client extension with a `client-extension.yaml` file.

## Usage Details

This `client-extension.yaml` file defines an Editor Config Contributor extension definition:

```yaml
able-editorConfigContributor:
   editorConfigKeys:
      - contentEditor
      - description
      - sampleClassicEditor
      - sampleLegacyEditor
   name: Liferay Sample Editor Config Contributor
   type: editorConfigContributor
   url: index.js
```

Editor Config Contributor client extensions override existing CKEditor customization in a `ConfigContributor.java` file. Configuration options of the client extension must match the `ConfigContributor` it's overriding (portlet names, editor names, and editor config keys).

The required url property defines the JavaScript resource fileâ€™s location. The JavaScript resource must contain the custom element initialization code.

[The example workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace/client-extensions/liferay-sample-editor-config-contributor) includes a complete Editor Config Contributor client extension.

!!! important
    You must provide valid configurations. No validations are performed.

Client extensions are deployed on an instance-level basis, affecting editors placed on admin/site pages belonging to that virtual instance.
