# Managing Picklist Permissions

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4+`

Picklist is integrated with Liferay's permissions framework. This means you can assign [application](#application-permissions) and [resource](#resource-permissions) permissions to user roles to determine which users have access to the Picklists application and its data.

![Assign Picklist permissions when defining Role permissions.](./managing-picklist-permissions/images/01.png)

See [Defining Role Permissions](../../../users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.md) for more information about assigning permissions to user roles.

## Application Permissions

Application permissions grant permission to perform general application-related operations and do not include [resource-related permissions](#resource-permissions).

Picklists has the following application permissions:

| Permission              | Description                                                         |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Access in Control Panel | Access Picklists in the Global Menu                                 |
| Configuration           | View and modify configuration options for the Picklists application |
| Permissions             | View and modify Picklists permissions                               |
| Preferences             | View and modify preferences for the Picklists application           |
| View                    | View the Picklists application                                      |

## Resource Permissions

Resource permissions grant permissions on specific application resources. Some of these permissions enable performing [operations on database entities](#resource-related-actions) (i.e., model resources). Others grant permission to perform [resource-related operations](#actions-on-database-entities) in an application context (e.g., create a new resource entity).

The Picklists application has the following resource permissions.

### Resource-Related Actions

| Permission               | Description                                      |
|:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Add List Type Definition | Create a Picklist type definition                |
| Permissions              | View and manage permissions related to Picklists |

### Actions on Database Entities

| Permission  | Description                                |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Delete      | Delete a Picklist                          |
| Permissions | View and modify permissions for a Picklist |
| Update      | Update a Picklist                          |
| View        | View a Picklist                            |
