{bdg-secondary}`Available Liferay DXP/Portal 7.4+`

Liferay Objects provides a convenient UI for [creating](./creating-and-managing-objects/creating-objects.md) custom applications that meet your business needs without writing code. You can also use Objects to [manage and extend](./creating-and-managing-objects/managing-objects.md) both system and custom Objects. This includes adding [fields](./creating-and-managing-objects/adding-fields-to-objects.md), [relationships](./creating-and-managing-objects/defining-object-relationships.md), [actions](./creating-and-managing-objects/defining-object-actions.md), [layouts](creating-and-managing-objects/designing-object-layouts.md), and [views](./creating-and-managing-objects/designing-object-views.md).

```{note}
Custom fields, layouts, and views are not supported for system Objects.
