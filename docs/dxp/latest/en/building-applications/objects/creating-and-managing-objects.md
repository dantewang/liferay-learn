{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4+`

Liferay Objects provides a convenient UI for [creating](./creating-and-managing-objects/creating-objects.md) custom applications that meet your business needs without writing code. You can also use Objects to manage and extend both system and custom objects. This includes adding [fields](./creating-and-managing-objects/fields.md), [relationships](./creating-and-managing-objects/relationships.md), [actions](./creating-and-managing-objects/actions.md), [layouts](./creating-and-managing-objects/layouts.md), [views](./creating-and-managing-objects/views.md), [validations](./creating-and-managing-objects/validations.md), and [custom states](./creating-and-managing-objects/fields/adding-and-managing-custom-states.md). See [Objects Application Permissions](./objects-application-permissions.md) to learn about the permissions necessary for performing these and other actions related to object definitions.

```{note}
System objects are default Liferay applications integrated with the objects framework, while custom objects are definitions created and published by a user.
