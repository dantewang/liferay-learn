# Using Batch APIs

When you publish an Object, Liferay automatically generates REST APIs for it. These include the batch APIs for bulk POST, PUT, and DELETE operations. Here you'll use cURL commands to call these batch APIs for a custom Object.

Before proceeding, [set up](#setting-up-a-liferay-instance) a new Liferay DXP/Portal 7.4 instance and [prepare](#preparing-the-sample-code) the provided tutorial code.

```{tip}
For a complete list of APIs generated for both Site and Company Objects, see [Object's Headless Framework Integration](../using-custom-object-apis.md). You can view and test custom Object APIs via the Liferay API Explorer at `[server]:[port]/o/api` (e.g., `localhost:8080/o/api`). They appear under *REST Applications*.
```

## Setting Up a Liferay Instance

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Then, follow these steps to [create](../../creating-and-managing-objects/creating-objects.md) a basic Object for this tutorial:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), go to the *Control Panel* tab, and click *Objects*.

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add Button](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) and enter these values:

   | Field | Value |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | Label | `Able` |
   | Plural Label | `Ables` |
   | Name | `Able` |

1. Select the new *Object* draft, go to the *Fields* tab, and add a single text *field*:

   | Label | Field Name | Type | Required |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | Name | name | Text | &#10004; |

1. Go to the *Details* tab and click *Publish*.

   ```{important}
   For this tutorial, you must use the above values.
   ```

[Publishing an Object](../../creating-and-managing-objects/creating-objects.md#publishing-object-drafts) creates and activates a new application for receiving and storing data. You can now access it via Headless APIs.

## Preparing the Sample Code

Run the following commands to download and unzip the provided sample code:

```bash
curl https://resources.learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/building-applications/objects/objects-tutorials/using-apis/liferay-t4r3.zip -O
```

```bash
unzip liferay-t4r3.zip
```

These scripts include the following batch APIs:

| HTTP Method | HTTP Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DELETE | `/batch` | Deletes multiple Object entries |
| POST | `/batch` | Creates multiple Object entries using the details provided in the API call |
| PUT | `/batch` | Replaces multiple Object entries using the details provided in the API call |

```{note}
The GET method is included for demonstration purposes. This returns a complete list of Object entries in a Liferay instance.
```

## Calling the Custom Object's APIs

1. After downloading the sample code, navigate to the `curl` folder in the `liferay-t4r3` project.

   ```bash
   cd liferay-t4r3/curl
   ```

1. Execute `Ables_POST_Batch`. This creates multiple Object entries.

   ```bash
   ./Ables_POST_Batch.sh
   ```

   The terminal shows a similar output.

   ```json
   {
     "className" : "com.liferay.object.rest.dto.v1_0.ObjectEntry",
     "contentType" : "JSON",
     "errorMessage" : "",
     "executeStatus" : "INITIAL",
     "externalReferenceCode" : "",
     "failedItems" : [ ],
     "id" : 4,
     "importStrategy" : "ON_ERROR_FAIL",
     "operation" : "CREATE",
     "processedItemsCount" : 0,
     "startTime" : "2022-04-07T22:51:37Z",
     "totalItemsCount" : 0
   }
   ```

1. Run `Ables_GET_FromCompany` to verify the entries were created. This returns a list of all Object entries.

   ```bash
   ./Ables_GET_FromCompany.sh
   ```

   Copy each entry's ID for use with the following PUT and DELETE methods.

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "items" : [ {
       ...
       "id" : 41985,
       ...
       "name" : "Able 1"
     }, {
       ...
       "id" : 41987,
       ...
       "name" : "Able 2"
     }, {
       ...
       "id" : 41989,
       ...
       "name" : "Able 3"
     } ],
     "lastPage" : 1,
     "page" : 1,
     "pageSize" : 20,
     "totalCount" : 3
   }
   ```

1. Execute `Ables_PUT_Batch` with each entry ID as a parameter. This replaces the details of the specified entry with the details provided in the API call.

   ```bash
   ./Ables_PUT_Batch.sh {first-entry-id} {second-entry-id} {third-entry-id}
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "className" : "com.liferay.object.rest.dto.v1_0.ObjectEntry",
     "contentType" : "JSON",
     "errorMessage" : "",
     "executeStatus" : "INITIAL",
     "externalReferenceCode" : "",
     "failedItems" : [ ],
     "id" : 6,
     "importStrategy" : "ON_ERROR_FAIL",
     "operation" : "UPDATE",
     "processedItemsCount" : 0,
     "startTime" : "2022-04-07T23:02:17Z",
     "totalItemsCount" : 0
   }
   ```

1. Run `Ables_GET_FromCompany` to verify the entries were updated.

   ```bash
   ./Ables_GET_FromCompany.sh
   ```

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "items" : [ {
       ...
       "id" : 41985,
       ...
       "name" : "Able One"
     }, {
       ...
       "id" : 41987,
       ...
       "name" : "Able Two"
     }, {
       ...
       "id" : 41989,
       ...
       "name" : "Able Three"
     } ],
     "lastPage" : 1,
     "page" : 1,
     "pageSize" : 20,
     "totalCount" : 3
   }
   ```

1. Execute `Ables_DELETE_Batch` with each entry ID as a parameter. This deletes the specified entries.

   ```bash
   ./Ables_DELETE_Batch.sh {first-entry-id} {second-entry-id} {third-entry-id}
   ```

1. Run `Ables_GET_FromCompany` to verify the entries were deleted.

   ```bash
   ./Ables_GET_FromCompany.sh
   ```

   Since you deleted the entries in the preceding step, it returns an entries `NOT FOUND` error.
