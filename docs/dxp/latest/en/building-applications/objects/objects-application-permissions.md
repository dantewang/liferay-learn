# Objects Application Permissions

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2023.Q4+/GA102+`

The Objects application is integrated with the permissions framework, so you can assign [application](#application-permissions) and [resource](#resource-permissions) permissions to user roles to determine which users can access the application and its data.

See [Defining Role Permissions](../../users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.md) for more information about assigning permissions to user roles.

## Application Permissions

Application permissions grant permission to perform general application-related operations and do not include [resource-related permissions](#resource-permissions).

Objects has the following application permissions:

## Resource Permissions

Resource permissions grant access to view, create, and act on definitions and folders in the Objects application. Some of these permissions are for [creating entities](#object-definitions-resource-related-actions) while others are for acting on existing entities (e.g., [definitions](#object-definition-for-existing-custom-definitions) and [folders](#object-folder-for-existing-object-folders)).

Objects has the following resource permissions.
