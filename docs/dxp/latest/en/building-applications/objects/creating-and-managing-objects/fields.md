# Fields

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2023.Q4+/GA102+`

Object fields are data definitions that represent database columns and store different types of values. All objects include default system fields, but you can [add custom fields](./fields/adding-fields-to-objects.md) to both draft and published objects.

When you [publish](./creating-objects.md#publishing-object-drafts) an object draft, Liferay creates an initial database table that includes all fields and relationships in the draft at the time of publishing. Fields and relationships added after publishing are added to a side table (i.e., `[Initial_Table_Name]_x`).

Liferay provides these field types that correspond to specific data types in the back-end:

| Field Types (UI)                              | Data Type (HEADLESS) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

After adding the field, go to the Advanced tab to set a default value. You can set this value manually by selecting a specific picklist option or dynamically using the expression builder.                                                              |

| Text (*previously String*)                    | String               | Stores simple text values up to 280 characters. You can choose to allow only unique values.
