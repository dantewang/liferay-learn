# Using Nested Fields with REST APIs

With custom Object APIs, you can use the `nestedFields` parameter to return multiple levels of related Objects in a single GET request. You can also use the `nestedFieldsDepth` parameter to determine the depth of Object entries included in the query: `0-5`. Here you'll use cURL scripts to call Object APIs with nested fields.

```{tip}
Nested fields are a convenient way to retrieve information that would usually require multiple requests. This way you can have all the information of a related entity from the entity itself without sending a new request with the related entity id.
```

Before proceeding, [set up](#setting-up-a-liferay-instance) a new Liferay DXP/Portal 7.4 instance and [prepare](#preparing-the-sample-code) the provided tutorial code.

## Setting Up a Liferay Instance

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Then, follow these steps to [create](../../creating-and-managing-objects/creating-objects.md) three Objects:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), go to the *Control Panel* tab, and click *Objects*.

1. Create three Object drafts.

   First Object:

      | Field | Value |
      | :--- | :--- |
      | Label | `Able` |
      | Plural Label | `Ables` |
      | Name | `Able` |

   Second Object:

      | Field | Value |
      | :--- | :--- |
      | Label | `Baker` |
      | Plural Label | `Bakers` |
      | Name | `Baker` |

   Third Object:

      | Field | Value |
      | :--- | :--- |
      | Label | `Charlie` |
      | Plural Label | `Charlies` |
      | Name | `Charlie` |

1. Add the following text field to each Object draft.

   | Label | Field Name | Type | Required |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | `Name` | `name` | Text | &#10004; |

1. Define the following relationships.

   For Able:

      | Label | Relationship Name | Type | Object |
      | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
      | `Able to Baker` | `ableToBaker` | One to Many | Baker |

   For Baker:

      | Label | Relationship Name | Type | Object |
      | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
      | `Baker to Charlie` | `bakerToCharlie` | One to Many | Charlie |

1. [Publish](../../creating-and-managing-objects/creating-objects.md#publishing-object-drafts) each Object.

Once published, you can access each Object via Headless APIs.

## Preparing the Sample Code

Run the following commands to download and unzip the provided sample code:

```bash
curl https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/building-applications/objects/objects-tutorials/using-apis/liferay-w4s7.zip -O
```

```bash
unzip liferay-w4s7.zip
```

The sample code includes POST commands for each Object, as well as a GET command for `Charlie`.

```{tip}
For a complete list of APIs generated for both Site and Company Objects, see [Object's Headless Framework Integration](../../understanding-object-integrations/headless-framework-integration.md). You can view and test custom Object APIs via the Liferay API Explorer at `[server]:[port]/o/api` (e.g., `localhost:8080/o/api`). They appear under *REST Applications*.
```

## Using the Sample Code

Follow these steps to add and query related Object entries:

1. Navigate to the `curl` folder in the `liferay-w4s7` project.

   ```bash
   cd liferay-p8n6/curl
   ```

1. Execute `Able_POST_ToCompany` to create `Able` entries.

   ```bash
   ./Able_POST_ToCompany.sh
   ```

   Copy the first entry's ID for use with the following POST command.

   ```bash
   {
     "id" : 41969,
     ...
     "name" : "Able 1"
   }

   {
     "id" : 41971,
     ...
     "name" : "Able 2"
   }

   {
     "id" : 41973,
     ...
     "name" : "Able 3"
   }
   ```

1. Execute `Baker_POST_ToCompany` using the `Able` entry ID as a parameter.

   ```bash
   ./Baker_POST_ToCompany.sh {able-entry-id}
   ```

   This creates `Baker` entries related to the specified `Able` entry. Copy the first `Baker` entry ID for use with the following POST command.

   ```bash
   {
     "id" : 41975,
     ...
     "name" : "Baker 1"
     "r_ableToBaker_c_ableId" : 41969
   }

   {
     "id" : 41977,
     ...
     "name" : "Baker 2"
     "r_ableToBaker_c_ableId" : 41969
   }

   {
     "id" : 41979,
     ...
     "name" : "Baker 3"
     "r_ableToBaker_c_ableId" : 41969
   }
   ```

1. Execute `Charlie_POST_ToCompany` using the `Baker` entry ID as a parameter.

   ```bash
   ./Charlie_POST_ToCompany.sh {baker-entry-id}
   ```

   This creates `Charlie` entries related to the preceding `Baker` entry. Copy the first entry's ID for use with the following GET command.

   ```bash
   {
     "id" : 41981,
     ...
     "name" : "Charlie 1",
     "r_bakerToCharlie_c_bakerId" : 41975
   }

   {
     "id" : 41983,
     ...
     "name" : "Charlie 2",
     "r_bakerToCharlie_c_bakerId" : 41975
   }

   {
     "id" : 41985,
     ...
     "name" : "Charlie 3",
     "r_bakerToCharlie_c_bakerId" : 41975
   }
   ```

1. Execute `Charlie_GET_ById` using the `Charlie` entry ID as a parameter.

   ```bash
   ./Charlie_GET_ById.sh [charlie-entry-id]
   ```

   This queries the entry using nested fields and returns the schema for all three levels of the related Objects.

   ```bash
   {
     "r_bakerToCharlie_c_baker" : {
       ...
       "id" : 41975,
       ...
       "r_ableToBaker_c_able" : {
         ...
         "id" : 41969,
         ...
         "name" : "Able 1"
       },
       "name" : "Baker 1",
       "r_ableToBaker_c_ableId" : 41969
     },
     "name" : "Charlie 1",
     "r_bakerToCharlie_c_bakerId" : 41975
   }
   ```

## Examining the GET Script

```{literalinclude} ./using-nested-fields-with-rest-apis/resources/liferay-w4s7.zip/curl/Charlie_GET_ById.sh
   :language: bash
```

The provided GET method calls a URL with the `nestedFields` and `nestedFieldsDepth` parameters.

`nestedFields`: Determines the types of entries included in the query (e.g., `able,baker`).

`nestedFieldsDepth`: Determines the depth of entries you want to include and can be set between 0-5.
