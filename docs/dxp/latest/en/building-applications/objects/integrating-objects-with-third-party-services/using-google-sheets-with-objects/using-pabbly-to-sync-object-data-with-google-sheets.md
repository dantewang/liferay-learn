# Using Pabbly to Sync Object Data with Google Sheets

{bdg-secondary}`Available 7.4+`

Here you'll learn how to use webhooks to trigger sync tasks between Liferay Objects and Google Sheets using [Pabbly](https://www.pabbly.com/). Syncing your data in this way requires an Pabbly account, Google Spreadsheet, and active DXP 7.4 instance. The DXP instance must also have a published Object with the desired fields for sending or receiving data to the Google Spreadsheet.

## Syncing Object Data to a Google Sheet

Follow these steps to sync Object data to a Google Sheet:

1. Sign in to [Pabbly](https://www.pabbly.com/), navigate to the *All Apps* page, and click *Pabbly Connect*.

1. In your Liferay instance, use the copied URL to [define an Object action](../../creating-and-managing-objects/actions/defining-object-actions.md) that sends a request to the webhook endpoint whenever a new Object entry is added.
