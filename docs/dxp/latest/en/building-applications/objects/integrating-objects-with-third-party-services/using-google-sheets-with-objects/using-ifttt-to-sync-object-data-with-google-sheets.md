# Using IFTTT to Sync Object Data with Google Sheets

{bdg-secondary}`Available 7.4+`

Here you'll learn how to use webhooks to trigger sync tasks between Liferay Objects and Google Sheets using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). Syncing your data in this way requires an IFTTT account, Google Spreadsheet, and active DXP 7.4 instance. The DXP instance must also have a published Object with the desired fields for sending or receiving data to the Google Spreadsheet.
