# Using Workato to Sync Object Data with Google Sheets

{bdg-secondary}`Available 7.4+`

Here you'll learn how to use webhooks to trigger sync tasks between Liferay Objects and Google Sheets using [Workato](https://www.workato.com/). Syncing your data in this way requires an Workato account, Google Spreadsheet, and active DXP 7.4 instance. The DXP instance must also have a published Object with the desired fields for sending or receiving data to the Google Spreadsheet.

## Syncing Object Data to a Google Sheet

Follow these steps to sync Object data to a Google Sheet:

1. Log in to [Workato](https://www.workato.com/) and navigate to the *Projects* page.

1. Navigate to the *Recipes* page and click *Create Recipe*.

1. Enter a recipe *Name*, *Location*, and pick the *Trigger from a webhook* starting point. Then click *Start building*.

1. Enter an *Event Name* and copy the generated *webhook URL*.

1. In your Liferay instance, use the copied URL to [define an Object action](../../creating-and-managing-objects/actions/defining-object-actions.md) that sends a request to the webhook endpoint whenever a new Object entry is added.

1. Click *Next* and add a test Object entry to trigger the webhook.

   This allows the webhook module to determine the Object's data structure automatically.

1. Verify if the test successfully determined the Object's data structure and click *Setup Webhook*
