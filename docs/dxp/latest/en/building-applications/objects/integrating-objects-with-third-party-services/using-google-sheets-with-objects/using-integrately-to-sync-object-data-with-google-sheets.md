# Using Integrately to Sync Object Data with Google Sheets

{bdg-secondary}`Available 7.4+`

Here you'll learn how to use webhooks to trigger sync tasks between Liferay Objects and Google Sheets using [Integrately](https://integrately.com/). Syncing your data in this way requires an Integrately account, Google Spreadsheet, and active DXP 7.4 instance. The DXP instance must also have a published Object with the desired fields for sending or receiving data to the Google Spreadsheet.

## Syncing Object Data to a Google Sheet

Follow these steps to sync Object data to a Google Sheet:

1. Sign in to [Integrately](https://integrately.com/) and click *New Automation*.

1. In your Liferay instance, use the copied URL to [define an Object action](../../creating-and-managing-objects/actions/defining-object-actions.md) that sends a request to the webhook endpoint whenever a new Object entry is added.

1. Add a test Object entry to trigger the webhook.

   This allows the Webhook app to determine the Object's data structure automatically.

1. In Integrately, click *I have set this URL in Webhook/API Integration*.

1. Click *Done, Check if received*.
