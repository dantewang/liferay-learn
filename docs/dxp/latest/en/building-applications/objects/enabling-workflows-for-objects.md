# Enabling Workflow for Objects

> Available: Liferay DXP/Portal 7.4+

Every published object is integrated automatically with the Workflow framework, so you can direct object entry creation through a defined review and approval process. How you enable a Workflow for an object depends on the object's scope: [Company](#company-scoped-objects) or [Site](#site-scoped-objects).

See [Workflow](../../process-automation/workflow.md) documentation to learn more about general workflow features.
