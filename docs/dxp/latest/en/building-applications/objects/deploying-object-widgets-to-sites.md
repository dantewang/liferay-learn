# Deploying Object Widgets to Sites

> Available: Liferay DXP 7.4 U1/Liferay Portal 7.4 GA5

When an Object is published, Liferay automatically generates a dedicated widget you can deploy to Site Pages. This includes both Site-scoped and Company-scoped Objects, so you can grant access to an Object outside of the Site Menu (![Site Menu](../../images/icon-menu.png)) and Global Menu (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)).

```{note}
Widget data is saved and displayed according to the Object's scope.
```

## Showing and Hiding Object Widgets

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), go to the *Control Panel* tab, and click *Objects*.

1. Select the desired *Object*.

1. In the Details tab, toggle the *Show/Hide Widget* switch.

   ![Toggle the Show/Hide Widget switch.](./deploying-object-widgets-to-sites/images/01.png)

1. Click *Save*.

If the switch is toggled to *Show Widget* and the Object is published, you can immediately [add the widget to Site Pages](#adding-the-widget-to-pages).

However, if the switch is toggled to *Hide Widget*, it is hidden in the widget menu and cannot be added to a page.

```{note}
Hiding an Object's widget does not remove it from Site Pages where it is already deployed. Hiding the widget only prevents users from adding it to a new Page.
```

## Adding the Widget to Pages

When *Show Widget* is enabled for a Published Object, its widgets appear under *Objects* in the widget menu.

You can add the widget to Site Pages like any other Page widget.

You can also click the widget's *Options* button (![Options Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)) to access additional functions and configuration options.

Available options depend on whether the widget is deployed to a [Content Page](../../site-building/creating-pages/using-content-pages/using-widgets-on-a-content-page.md) or [Widget Page](../../site-building/creating-pages/using-widget-pages.md).
