# Filtering and Sorting Web Content Articles

!!! important
    Some features are currently behind release feature flags (LPS-194763 and LPS-196768). Read [Release Feature Flags](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#release-feature-flags) for more information.

The web content application shows a list of all the web content articles you can access under the Web Content tab. The filtering and sorting options help you find and review items faster.

![You can filter web content articles from the web content application and order the articles to get a more precise result](./filtering-and-sorting-web-content-articles/images/01.png)

When viewing all assets, assets in a specific folder, assets resulting from a web content search, or in the Web Content view of an Asset Library, you can use four different filter and sort options. In addition, as of Liferay 7.4 2024.Q1+, you can filter web content articles through highlighted web content structures and search for keywords only in the title, comments, or all fields:

- {bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2024.Q1+` [Filter by Highlighted Web Content Structure](#filter-by-highlighted-web-content-structure)
- [Filter by Navigation](#filter-by-navigation)
- [Filter by Status](#filter-by-status)
- [Filter by Type](#filter-by-type)
- [Order by](#order-by)
- {bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2024.Q1+` [Filter Search Results](#filter-search-results)

You can combine (single or multiple) filters and order your results for an enhanced experience. For example, if you select the "Product Advertisement Blog Post" [highlighted structure](#filter-by-highlighted-web-content-structures), the [Mine](#filter-by-navigation), [Draft](#filter-by-status), [order by Title](#order-by), and the [Ascending order](#order-by) filters, you obtain a list of your articles that use the "Product Advertisement Blog Post" web content structure, are in Draft status, and are ordered by title in ascending alphabetical order.

!!! note
    (**Breaking Change**) All filtering options apply exclusively to the current folder. Web content articles located elsewhere are not included in the filtered results.

    Also, if you initiate a new search, the filters reset, and the search extends to all assets in the folder.

## Filter by Highlighted Web Content Structure

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2024.Q1+`

!!! important
    This feature is currently behind a release feature flag (LPS-194763). Read [Release Feature Flags](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#release-feature-flags) for more information.

You can select web content structures and see only web content articles that belong to those selected structures. To choose which structures to highlight,

1. Open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)), expand *Content & Data*, and click *Web Content*.

1. Click *Options* (![Options icon](../../../images/icon-options.png)) at the top right corner and select *Configuration*.

1. Under Settings, select *Structures* and click *Select* to choose structures to highlight.

   ![In the Configuration menu, select the structures you want to  highlight](./filtering-and-sorting-web-content-articles/images/02.png)

1. In the modal that opens, select the structures you want to highlight and click *Add*.

With the highlighted structures selected, a menu appears on the left with the Content Library option and the selected structures under the Highlighted Structures section.

The Content Library option shows all web content articles and their folder hierarchy whereas the highlighted structure shows all articles using that specific structure regardless of folder hierarchy.

## Filter by Navigation

When you filter by navigation, you filter the web content articles you have permission to view in the selected folder.

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2024.Q1+` You can apply a single filter or multiple filters. Also, when selecting categories/tags, you can select multiple categories/tags.
<!-- add the highlighted structure here in addition to the folder -->
