# Translating Pages and Content

Liferay provides integrated tools for translating both Web Content and Content Page experiences. With these tools you can manually translate text in a side-by-side editor, automatically generate translations using third party services, or export and import XLIFF files. You can also enable custom workflows to direct the review and publishing process for all translations.

The languages available for translation are determined by your instance's localization settings. See [Initial Instance Localization](../installation-and-upgrades/setting-up-liferay/initial-instance-localization.md) and [Virtual Instance Localization](../system-administration/configuring-liferay/virtual-instances/localization.md) for more information.
