# Auto-Tagging

Auto-tagging is the process of assigning descriptive tags or labels to digital content automatically without manual intervention. When having multiple content, auto-tagging organizes and groups this content by determining related tags, which is assigned according to attributes, context, or metadata.

Liferay offers the option for automatic tagging assets and images within your work processes, allowing the user to configure it at three levels: *Global*, *Virtual Instance* and *Site*. The user can review and adjust tags to meet the accuracy and validity of their specific requirements. The following articles will teach how to configure and use this functionality.
