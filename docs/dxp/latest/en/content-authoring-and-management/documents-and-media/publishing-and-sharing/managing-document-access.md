# Managing Document Access

Effectively managing document access in Liferay ensures that your organizationâ€™s data remains secure while being accessible to the right users.

Control document access by [setting specific permissions](./managing-document-access/permissions-and-documents.md). Define who can create, view, download, and manage each Documents and Media assets, whether it's an individual file, an entire folder, or a specific file type, to maintain tight security over your content. Refer to the [documents and media permissions reference](./managing-document-access/documents-and-media-permissions-reference.md) for detailed information on permissions.

[Share documents with colleagues](./managing-document-access/sharing-documents-with-other-users.md) by configuring the sharing settings. Ensure that users have the necessary permissions to view, edit, or comment on shared documents. [Enable document sharing](./managing-document-access/enabling-and-configuring-sharing.md) by configuring the sharing settings in your Liferay instance. Customize sharing options to suit your organizational needs, ensuring that only authorized users can share documents.

By implementing these practices, you can maintain a secure and efficient document management system.
