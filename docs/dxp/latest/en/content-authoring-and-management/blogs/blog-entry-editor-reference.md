# Blog Entry Editor Reference

The blog entry editor provides context appropriate editing tools for formatting text, managing images, tables, and other rich features. Users are able to switch to code view to directly edit the content’s HTML. All draft entries are automatically saved every 25 seconds.

## Using the Editor’s Text View

The Text view is a WYSIWYG editor that lets you enter and edit text and other types of content.

To style or format text in the content area, select the text. A toolbar appears above the text that contains the following options:

| Function   | Description |
| :--------- | :--- |
| Text Style | Choose the text’s style. Normal is typical body text, but you can also select from different heading styles, alert or error message styles, code style, and more. |
| Typeface   | Select bold, italic, or underline. |
| List Style | Select a numbered or bulleted list. |
| Link       | Link the selected text to a specific URL, or to an item in the portal. |
| Twitter    | Generates a link to tweet the selected text. |

When the cursor hovers in the entry's content area, the Add icon (+) appears. Clicking the Add icon shows controls for inserting an image, video, table, or horizontal line ( ![Controls](../../images/icon-content-insert-controls.png) ).

| Function | Description                                                                                                                         |

| Table    | Insert a table.                                                                                                                     |
