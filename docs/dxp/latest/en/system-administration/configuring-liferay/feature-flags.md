# Feature Flags

{bdg-secondary}`DXP 7.4 U69+/GA69+`

Liferay now includes *Feature Flags* for release and beta features. The goal is to provide more control over the functionality onboarded into Liferay DXP, and get new and experimental features adopted and validated more effectively.

To access and manage feature flags, open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Instance Settings*. Click *Feature Flags* under *Platform*. There are two types of feature flags: 

* Beta
* Release

## Beta Feature Flags

Beta features are functional features undergoing business validation. These are experimental and require careful consideration before usage. Beta features may be deprecated after a limited time period or converted into a release feature. You can give your valuable feedback on beta features through one of the following channels:

* [Community Slack](https://liferay.dev/chat)

* Create a JIRA Ticket

To enable a beta feature, 

1. Click *Beta* on the left menu. 

1. You can find a list of all beta features listed. Use the toggle to enable or disable a feature. 

You can also use the search bar to find beta features quickly, sort them using the Sort (![Sort](../../images/icon-sort2.png)) button, or filter them based on their status.

## Release Feature Flags

Release features are fully functional features baked into the product but under a flag for a limited time period. This flag allows you to control the visibility of a feature and enable it once your organization or team has learned more about it. 

To enable a release feature, 

1. Click *Release* on the left menu. 

1. You can find a list of all release features listed. Use the toggle to enable or disable a feature. 

You can also use the search bar to find beta features quickly, sort them using the Sort (![Sort](../../images/icon-sort2.png)) button, or filter them based on their status. After a limited time period, release features are included in Liferay DXP out-of-the-box.
