# Calendar

The Calendar widget stores and shares scheduled events. It's a personal planner for individual users, a shared calendar for an entire site, or both at the same time. It can be used to create multiple calendars for a single site or user, to overlay the events stored in multiple calendars for simultaneous view, to send email reminders to users, and more.

!!! note
    The calendar supports social activities. Whenever a calendar event is added or updated, a corresponding social activity notification is created. If the event was added or updated in a calendar that the current user has permission to view, the social activity is viewable in the [Activities widget](./social-tools/using-the-activities-widget.md).

Start by learning how to [use the Calendar widget](./calendar/using-the-calendar-widget.md) and [configure it](./calendar/calendar-widget-configuration-reference.md). Then, you can [export/import](./calendar/exporting-importing-calendar-data.md) the calendar data and display calendar event information by [mapping it to display page templates](./calendar/mapping-calendar-event-fields-to-display-page-templates.md) which gives you more options to use the calendar data throughout sites.

<!-- Intro is a good start, but it needs a features list and a screenshot or two. List what the calendar does, so people can see it's a fine replacement for whatever they're currently using, or that they can see themselves using it on an enterprise level. -Rich -->
