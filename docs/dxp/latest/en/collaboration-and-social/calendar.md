# Calendar

The Calendar widget is a tool for storing and sharing scheduled events. It's a personal planner for individual users, a shared calendar for an entire site, or both at the same time. It can be used to create multiple calendars for a single site or user, to send email reminders to users, and more.

!!! note
    The calendar supports social activities. Whenever a calendar event is added or updated, a corresponding social activity notification is created. If the event was added or updated in a calendar that the current user has permission to view, the social activity is viewable in the [Activities widget](./social-tools/using-the-activities-widget.md).

Start by learning how to [use the Calendar widget](./calendar/using-the-calendar-widget.md) and [configure it](./calendar/calendar-widget-configuration-reference.md). Then, you can [export/import](./calendar/exporting-importing-calendar-data.md) the calendar data and display calendar event information by [mapping it to display page templates](./calendar/mapping-calendar-event-fields-to-display-page-templates.md) which gives you more options to use the calendar data throughout sites.
