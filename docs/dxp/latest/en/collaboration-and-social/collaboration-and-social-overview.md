## Social Tools

The following social applications are included with Liferay DXP:

- [Activities](./social-tools/using-the-activities-widget.md)
- [Contacts Center](./social-tools/using-the-contacts-center-widget.md)

These tools are building blocks for building an integrated, social experience for users. Activities provide a configurable feed of the actions users take on a site. Contacts Center allows users to search, view, and establish social relations with other users.

## Invitations

When Users confirm such invitations, they become Site members assigned to the Roles defined by the site administrator. Click to learn more about [Site Membership](../site-building/sites/site-membership/adding-members-to-sites.md).
