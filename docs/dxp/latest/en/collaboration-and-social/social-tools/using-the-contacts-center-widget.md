# Using the Contacts Center Widget

 With the Contacts Center widget, users can form two connection types: [Connect](#connecting-with-a-user) and [Follow](#following-a-user).

 Connected users can see each other's activities in their private dashboard displays while followers can see the followed users' activities in their private dashboard.

After the [widget is deployed on a user's private dashboard](#adding-the-contacts-center-to-a-user-dashboard), users can form their own social connections.
