# Social Tools

Social tools play a vital role in fostering engagement, collaboration, and interaction within digital environments. They are designed to enhance user experiences and facilitate connections. Liferay DXP offers three powerful social tools: the [Activities Widget](./social-tools/using-the-activities-widget.md), [Contacts Center Widget](./social-tools/using-the-contacts-center-widget.md), and [Ratings System](./social-tools/using-the-ratings-system.md).

With the [Activities widget](./social-tools/using-the-activities-widget.md), users can stay informed about recent activities, such as the addition, update, and deletion of items.
