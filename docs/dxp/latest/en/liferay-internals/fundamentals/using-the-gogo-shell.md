# Using the Gogo Shell

```{toctree}

```

The Gogo shell provides a way to interact with the module framework. Among other things, you can

* Dynamically install/uninstall bundles (modules)
* Examine package dependencies
* Examine extension points
* List service references

The control panel is the safest, most secure way to access Gogo shell:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), and select the *Control Panel* tab.

1. Click *Gogo Shell* in the System section.

   The Gogo shell command screen appears.

   ```{note}
   In DXP 7.2, open the Control Panel and navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *Gogo Shell*
   ```

1. Enter a Gogo shell command in the *g!* text field. For example, enter `lb | grep "Liferay Announcements API"` to list information about the Announcements API bundle.

   ```{note}
   If you have a cluster, you must run Gogo shell commands on all nodes. Commands run in the Control Panel's Gogo shell only affect the current node.
   ```

1. Click *Execute*.

    The command result output appears.

```{warning}
The Gogo shell is extremely powerful and can manipulate the platform's core functionality. Only grant Gogo shell access to trusted administrators. Please see [Understanding Roles and Permissions](../../users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/understanding-roles-and-permissions.md) for more information.
