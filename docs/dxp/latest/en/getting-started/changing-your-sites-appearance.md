# Changing Your Site's Appearance

Liferay has many ways to customize your site's appearance. Your site's favicon and theme are two of the first elements you may want to change. Themes set a default look and feel for your site, while the favicon is an icon that identifies your site in the user's browser tab.

## Changing Your Site's Favicon

``` {include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Then, follow these steps:

1. Open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and navigate to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

1. Click *Actions* (![Action button](../images/icon-actions.png)) in the Application Bar and select *Configuration*.

   ![Open the Pages application, click Actions in the Application Bar, and select Configuration.](./changing-your-sites-appearance/images/01.png)

1. Under Favicon, click *Select Favicon* (![Select Favicon button](../images/icon-switch.png)).

   ![Click the Select Favicon button.](./changing-your-sites-appearance/images/02.png)

1. Select or upload an image.

1. Click *Save*.

Your site uses the chosen image for its favicon.

## Changing Your Site's Theme

By default, Liferay instances use the Classic theme, but you can deploy and use custom themes.

### Deploy a New Theme

1. Download and unzip the Acme Sample Blue Theme WAR file:

    ```bash
    curl https://resources.learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/getting-started/changing-your-sites-appearance/resources/liferay-5b2v.zip -O
    ```

   ```bash
   unzip liferay-5b2v.zip
   ```

1. Go to the folder where the .war file is placed and deploy it:

    ```bash
    docker cp liferay-5b2v-theme.war [docker-container-id]:[path-to-deploy-folder]
    ```

!!! note
    To replace `[docker-container-id]`, use `docker ps` to find the liferay/portal container's ID. The `[path-to-deploy-folder]` is `opt/liferay/deploy`.

This loads the sample theme into your DXP instance. You can check your console for the following message to confirm the theme successfully deployed:

```
2023-12-21 16:01:20.836 INFO  [fileinstall-directory-watcher][BundleStartStopLogger:68] STARTED liferay-5b2v-theme_1.0.0 [1617]
```

### Change Your Site's Theme

1. Open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and navigate to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

1. Click *Actions* (![Action button](../images/icon-actions.png)) in the Application Bar and select *Configuration*.

   ![Open the Pages screen, click Actions in the Application Bar, and select Configuration.](./changing-your-sites-appearance/images/01.png)
