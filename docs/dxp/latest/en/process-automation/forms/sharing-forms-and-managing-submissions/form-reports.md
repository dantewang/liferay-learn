# Form Reports

> Available: Liferay CE/DXP 7.3

Once users begin submitting form entries, you can access a field-by-field report on the form's records:

1. Navigate to the Forms application. In the Product Menu (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)), go to _Content & Data_ &rarr; _Forms_.

1. Click the form's _Name_ to open the form builder view.

1. Click the _Entries_ tab. The first datum presented is the count of all entries currently submitted.

   Field-by-field metrics are presented next. Scroll through the fields or click a specific field from the list on the right to jump to its metrics.

Form Reports shows you aggregated form data. To see each form entry individually, see [Managing Form Entries](./managing-form-entries.md#viewing-form-entries).
```

## Form Fields and Chart Types

The data presentation is different depending on the field type:

| Field(s) | Data Display Format | Additional Information |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Color<br />Date<br />Number<br />Text| Field List | Number fields also include these summary statistics: Average, Maximum Value, Minimum Value, Sum |
| Select from List<br />Single Selection | Pie Chart | None |
| Grid<br />Multiple Selection | Bar Graph | Multiple Selection graphs are horizontal, where Grid graphs are vertical with grouped bars |
| Image<br />Paragraph<br />Rich Text<br />Separator<br />Upload | _No Metrics_ | These fields don't have metrics to report |

### Field Lists

The Color, Date, Number, and Text fields accept free-form data entry from the form's users, so data can't really be tabulated for these fields. Instead, they're presented as a simple list of responses. However, since the number field includes validation to ensure that only numeric data are entered, some summary statistics are compiled: average, sum, minimum value, and maximum value.

### Pie Charts

The Select from List and Single Selection fields accept only one entry selected from a list of choices. A pie chart is displayed to show the proportion of users' selections.

### Bar Graphs

The Multiple Selection field accepts multiple entries for one selection request (e.g., _Select the toppings for your sandwich_). The proportion of selections is displayed in a horizontal bar graph.

The Grid field accepts a single entry for each of multiple related questions (e.g., _Rate these Sylvester Stallone movies as Good, Bad, or No Opinion_). The proportion of selections is displayed in a vertical bar graph, with bars grouped by question.

### Show Partial Results to Form Respondents

> Available: Liferay 7.4+

The Submissions tab of a [Form's Settings modal](../creating-and-managing-forms/forms-configuration-reference.md#form-settings) has a checkbox for _Show Partial Results to Respondents_. Enabling this setting allows respondents to view the current [Forms Report](../sharing-forms-and-managing-submissions/form-reports.md) data for the form.

![Show in-progress form metrics to form respondents.](./form-reports/images/10.png)

Enabling this setting triggers an _Info_ message to the form respondent: _Your responses will be visible to all form respondents. Avoid entering personal or sensitive data._ The respondent can also check the box to submit that they understand the danger of submitting private information.
