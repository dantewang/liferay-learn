# Consuming APIs

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, serve as the bridge between different software applications, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. By consuming external APIs, developers can use existing functionalities and data sources to upgrade their applications without building everything from scratch.

## Consuming REST Services

Liferay DXP provides a full REST API framework that allows developers to interact with platform functionalities by accessing and manipulating data, creating custom integrations, and building complete applications.

A user has can call a service in many ways:

**Identify the service URL**: Liferay DXP REST service has a specific URL that the user must use in a request.

**Authentication**: Calling a service by *Authentication* guarantee that only authorized users or applications can access and manipulate data. An example is *OAuth 2.0*, that uses access tokens and authorizations codes.

**Data format**: Defines how information is structured and represented when exchanged between systems via REST APIs. Some common data formats are *JSON*, *XML* and *YAML*.

**HTTP methods**: The type of request the user make (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) depends on the operation that's being performed (retrieving data, creating data, updating data, or deleting data).

## Consuming GraphQL APIs

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It provides a complete description of the data that is available, and it gives users the power to ask for exactly what they need without receiving redundant information.

Unlike REST APIs, where you often get a lot of data (over-fetching), GraphQL allows users to request only the specific fields they need from a given object or resource, even using similar methods to call its services.

## Data Migration Center

Liferay provides a *Data Migration Center* to move objects entries between installations in a simple way. A user can easily *Export Objects Definitions*, *Import Objects Definitions*, *Export Object Entries* and *Import Object Entries*.

## Batch Engine API - Importing and Exporting data

Liferayâ€™s Headless Batch Engine provides REST APIs to import and export data. These APIs are transfer in various formats (CSV, JSON, XLSX), carrying a large dataset. Additionally, some APIs offer options for filtering data during export. For advanced users, customization through code is available for importing and exporting processes.

## Unauthenticated Requests

*Unauthenticated Requests* provide a gateway for public access to specific data and functionalities in a system. While offering convenience and accessibility, they also demand stringent security measures to protect sensitive information by *Relaxing API Restrictions via Service Access Policy*.

## Using External Reference Codes

By using *External Reference Codes* (ERCs), you have easy data synchronization and mapping between different systems. By using a common reference point, data can be consistently transferred and updated across platforms. During data migration processes, ERCs can be used to track and match records before and after the migration, trace the history of data changes and track previous data.

When interacting with external systems or databases through APIs, ERCs can serve as unique identifiers for records, facilitating data synchronization and mapping.

## API Headers Reference

API headers are essential components of HTTP requests that provide metadata about the request and the expected response. These header fields communicate information between the client and server, influencing how the request is processed and the format of the response. 

The following API headers are frequently used:

**Authorization**: Specifies the credentials for authenticating the request (e.g., Bearer token, Basic Auth).

**Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the request body (e.g., application/json, application/xml).

**Accept-Languages**: Usually the client's preferred natural languages.

**X-Accept-All-Languages**: Indicates client accepts all languages (non-standard).

**Cookie**: Sends cookie information to the server.
