```{important}
The API builder is a beta feature that currently only supports one Liferay object (and any relationships) at a time.
```

The API builder makes it easy for you to create custom API applications in Liferay. Follow the steps below to see a mock API application example of a school's courses and students.

To enable the API builder,

1. Navigate to _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Instance Settings_.

1. Click _Feature Flags_ under _Platform_.

1. Select _Beta_ in the left navigation. Enable the _API Builder_ toggle on. The API builder is now enabled.
