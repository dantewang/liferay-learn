To start using Marketplace, sign up for a Liferay account, or sign in to your existing account. There are two kinds of apps you can install from the Marketplace.

* Cloud Apps - These apps are provided as a [LUFFA](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions/packaging-client-extensions) and run on Liferay SaaS. -->

To publish apps on the Marketplace, you must [become a publisher](./marketplace/become-a-publisher.md).
