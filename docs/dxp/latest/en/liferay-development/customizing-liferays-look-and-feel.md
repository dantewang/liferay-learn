# Customizing Liferay's Look and Feel

One of the easiest ways to get started developing on Liferay's platform is to modify its look and feel. You can change everything from its favicon to its entire design to match your branding. As you determine your requirements for your look and feel, the best approach for customizing Liferay is to determine the minimum effort needed to achieve the desired result. The most compatible way to do this is to use [client extensions](./client-extensions.md). This gives you the most freedom, because you can use any of Liferay's deployment approaches: SaaS, PaaS, or self-hosted. You should be able to achieve what you want with client extensions for all but the most extreme cases. 

Customizations presented here go from simplest to the most complex: 

- Favico Client Extension
- CSS Client Extension
- JavaScript Client Extension
- Themes (PaaS or self-hosted only)

Read on to learn how to customize Liferay to match your design!
