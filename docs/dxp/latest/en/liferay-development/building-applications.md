# Building Applications

For maximum compatibility with all of Liferay's deployment options, you can combine Liferay's [Objects](./objects.md), [Client Extensions](./client-extensions.md), and other features and tools to build real-world solutions for your business needs. This is the recommended way to create applications using Liferay's platform. There are three examples here: a ticketing system, a time off requester, and a React-based application. 

Liferay's traditional Java-based development platform hasn't gone anywhere, and you can still build and deploy Java code to Liferay if you are on Liferay PaaS or self-hosted.
