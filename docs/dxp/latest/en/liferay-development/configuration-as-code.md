# Configuration As Code 

Sometimes---especially if you have many Liferay systems to configure---it's easier to configure Liferay with a deployable asset than to go in manually and set every setting via the UI. This is where configuration client extensions can help. 

Currently, there are three types of configuration client extensions: 

1. Instance Settings 

1. OAuth Headless Server 

1. OAuth User Agent

Read on to learn how to configure your Liferay instance through deployable code.
