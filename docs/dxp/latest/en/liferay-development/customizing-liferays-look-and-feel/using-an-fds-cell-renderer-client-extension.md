# Using an FDS Cell Renderer Client Extension

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4+`

Frontend Data Set (FDS) cell renderer client extensions allow you to customize the display for your [data set views](../data-sets/data-set-views.md). Use this type to process information in your data sets with a separately deployed function for the display. Start with a client extension from the [sample workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace).

## Prerequisites

To start developing client extensions,

1. Install Java (JDK 8 or JDK 11).

    !!! note
        Check the [compatibility matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-7-4-Compatibility-Matrix) for supported JDKs, databases, and environments. See [JVM Configuration](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/installation-and-upgrades/reference/jvm-configuration) for recommended JVM settings.

1. Download and unzip the sample workspace:

    ```bash
    curl -o com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/content\?r\=liferay-public-releases\&g\=com.liferay.workspace\&a\=com.liferay.sample.workspace\&\v\=LATEST\&p\=zip
    ```

    ```bash
    unzip com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip
    ```

Now you have the tools to deploy your first FDS cell renderer client extension.

## Examine and Modify the Client Extension

The FDS cell renderer client extension is in the sample workspace's `client-extensions/liferay-sample-fds-cell-renderer/` folder. It's defined in the `client-extension.yaml` file:

```yaml
liferay-sample-fds-cell-renderer:
    name: Liferay Sample Frontend Data Set Cell Renderer
    type: fdsCellRenderer
    url: index.*.js
```

The client extension has the ID `liferay-sample-fds-cell-renderer` and contains the key configurations for an FDS cell renderer client ectension, including the `type` and a URL where the exported renderer is located on deployment. See the [FDS cell renderer YAML configuration reference](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/fds-cell-renderer-yaml-reference.md) for more information on the available properties.

It also contains the `assemble` block:

```yaml
assemble:
    - from: build/static
      into: static
```

This specifies that every file created in the `build/static/` folder should be included as a static resource in the built client extension `.zip` file. The included `tsconfig.json` and `webpack.config.js` files include boilerplate configurations to build JavaScript from the entry point `src/index.ts` into the `build/static/` folder for the client extension.

The `index.ts` file contains this JavaScript code:

```js
const fdsCellRenderer: FDSTableCellHTMLElementBuilder = ({value}) => {
    const element = document.createElement('div');

    element.innerHTML = value === 'Green' ? 'üçè' : value.toString();

    return element;
};

export default fdsCellRenderer;
```

This defines a function `fdsCellRenderer` that retrieves an FDS cell's data (`value`) and sets its `innerHTML` property depending on the value: either the existing value used as a string, or a green apple icon (üçè) if the value is `Green`. Then it exports the function for use as a client extension.

On the line before the `innerHTML` property is set, add this code to shorten any value with `Joseph` to the nickname `Joe`:

```js
if (value === 'Joseph')
{
    value = 'Joe';
}
```

Now deploy the client extension.

## Deploy the FDS Cell Renderer

Start a new Liferay instance by running

```bash
docker run -it -m 8g -p 8080:8080 liferay/portal:7.4.3.120-ga120
```

Sign in to Liferay at `http://localhost:8080`. Use the email address `test@liferay.com` and the password `test`. When prompted, change the password to `learn`.

Once Liferay starts, run this command from the client extension's folder in the sample worksapce:

```bash
../../gradlew clean deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
```

This builds your client extension and deploys the zip to Liferay's `deploy/` folder.

!!! note
    The command used to deploy your client extension changes if you use a self-hosted instance outside of Docker, Liferay PaaS, or Liferay SaaS. See [Deploying to Your Liferay Instance](../client-extensions/working-with-client-extensions.md#deploying-to-your-liferay-instance) for more information.

!!! tip
    To deploy all client extensions in the workspace simultaneously, run the command from the `client-extensions/` folder.

Confirm the deployment in your Liferay instance's console:

```
STARTED liferaysamplefdscellrenderer_7.4.13 [1459]
```

Now that your custom FDS cell renderer is deployed, create and populate a data set to use it.

## Create a Data Set of Users

!!! note
    The FDS cell renderer client extension is currently behind a [beta feature flag](../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#beta-feature-flags). You must enable the feature flag before you start using it.

Create a data set that uses your client extension to render cells.

1. In your running Liferay instance, navigate to the Applications Menu ![Applications Menu](../../icon-applications-menu.png) &rarr; *Control Panel* &rarr; *Data Sets*.

1. Click Add ![Add icon](../../icon-add.png) to add a new data set.

1. Fill in the New Data Set form with these values:

    * **Name**: User Data Set

    * **REST Application**: /headless-admin-user/v1.0

    * **REST Schema**: UserAccount

    * **REST Endpoint**: /v1.0/user-accounts

    ![Configure a user data set to include all user accounts.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/01.png)

1. Click *Save*.

1. Click the new data set and click *New Data Set View*.

1. Enter *User View* as the name for the view and click *Save*.

    ![Create a view for the data set to determine how the data set is displayed.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/02.png)

1. Click the *Fields* tab.

1. Click Add ![Add icon](../../icon-add.png).

1. Select the `emailAddress`, `familyName`, and `givenName` fields and click *Save*.

    ![Select three fields to display when the data set is on a page.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/03.png)

    The `givenName` and `familyName` fields represent the user's first and last name, respectively.

1. On the `familyName` row, click Actions ![Actions icon](../../icon-actions.png) &rarr; *Edit*.

1. From the *Renderer* drop-down menu, select *Liferay Sample Frontend Data Set Cell Renderer*.

    ![Select the renderer you deployed via a client extension.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/04.png)

1. Click *Save*.

1. On the `givenName` row, click Actions ![Actions icon](../../icon-actions.png) &rarr; *Edit*.

1. From the *Renderer* drop-down menu, select *Liferay Sample Frontend Data Set Cell Renderer*.

1. Click *Save*.

1. Click the *Details* tab and click *Save* to confirm the changes.

Now you have a data set uses your new client extension to render users' first and last names.

### Add a New User

Next, add a user for the data set to display.

1. Navigate to the Applications Menu ![Applications](../../icon-applications-menu.png) &rarr; *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users and Organizations*.

1. Click *Add* ![Add icon](../../icon-add.png).

1. Fill in the user form's required fields with these values:

    * **Screen Name**: josephgreen

    * **Email Address**: josephgreen@Liferay.com

    * **First Name**: Joseph

    * **Last Name**: Green

    ![Enter the new user's data with values that your FDS cell renderer code will modify.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/05.png)

1. Click *Save*.

## Display the Data Set on a Page

1. Navigate to a blank page on any site.

1. Click *Edit* ![Edit icon](../../images/icon-edit.png) at the top of the page.

1. From the *Fragments and Widgets* menu on the left, scroll down to the *Content Display* section and drag a *Data Set* fragment onto the page.

    ![Use a Data Set fragment to display your data set view.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/06.png)

1. Click on the Data Set fragment.

1. Click Add ![Add icon](../../images/icon-plus.png) beside the *Data Set View* field in the configuration menu on the right.

1. Select *User View* as the data set view.

    ![Select User View to display all users with the fields you configured previously.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/07.png)

1. Click *Save*.

The data set fragment updates to display your data set of users. The first and last name for the new user, Joseph Green, display using values altered by your FDS cell renderer code (the nickname "Joe" and the green apple icon, üçè).

![Joseph Green's first and last names display differently because of your JavaScript processing the data.](./using-an-fds-cell-renderer-client-extension/images/08.png)
