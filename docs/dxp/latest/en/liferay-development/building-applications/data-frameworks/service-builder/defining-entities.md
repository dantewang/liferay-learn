# Defining Entities

Entities are the heart and soul of a service. They represent the map between the model objects in Java and your database fields and tables. [Service Builder](../service-builder.md) automatically maps your Java model to the entities you define, giving you a facility for persisting Java objects. Consider the Y7G4 sample project found in [Generating Model, Persistence, and Service Code](./service-builder-basics/generating-model-persistence-and-service-code.md). Here's the summary of the entity:

* **Name:** `Y7G4Entry`
* **Local service:** *yes*
* **Remote service:** *no* 

Here's how you define entities:

```xml
<entity local-service="true" name="Y7G4Entry" remote-service="false">
</entity>
```

The entity's database table name includes the entity name prefixed with the namespace. The Y7G4 example creates one database table named `Y7G4_Y7G4Entry`.

Setting *Local Service* (the `local-service` attribute) to `true` generates local interfaces for the entity's services. Local services can only be invoked from the Liferay server on which they're deployed.

Setting *Remote Service* (the `remote-service` attribute) to `true` generates JSON-based remote interfaces for the service. These are not REST services; for that, you should use [REST Builder](../../../../headless-delivery/apis-with-rest-builder/producing-and-implementing-apis-with-rest-builder.md). You can build a fully-functional application without generating remote services by setting your entity local services to `true` and remote services to `false`. If, however, you want to enable remote access to your application's services, set both local service and remote service to `true`.

```{tip}
If you have an existing Data Access Object (DAO) service for an entity built using some other framework such as JPA, you can set local service to ``false`` and remote service to ``true`` so that the methods of your remote ``-Impl`` class can call the methods of your existing DAO. This makes it easy to integrate with Liferay's permission-checking system and provides access to the web service APIs generated by Service Builder. This is a very handy, powerful, and often used feature of Liferay.
```
