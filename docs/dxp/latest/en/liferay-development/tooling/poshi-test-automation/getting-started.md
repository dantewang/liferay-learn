# Getting Started

Previously, Poshi tests could only be executed by downloading and creating the test files within the [Liferay source
code](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/). The _Poshi Standalone_ gradle project enables you to use Poshi in any directory of your choosing without having to fetch the entire Liferay Portal github repository.
