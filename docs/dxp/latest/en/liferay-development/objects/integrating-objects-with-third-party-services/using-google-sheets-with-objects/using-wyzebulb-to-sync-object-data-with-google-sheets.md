# Using Wyzebulb to Sync Object Data with Google Sheets

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4+`

Here you'll learn how to use webhooks to trigger sync tasks between Liferay Objects and Google Sheets using [Wyzebulb](https://www.wyzebulb.com/). Syncing your data in this way requires an Wyzebulb account, Google Spreadsheet, and active DXP 7.4 instance. The DXP instance must also have a published Object with the desired fields for sending or receiving data to the Google Spreadsheet.

## Syncing Object Data to a Google Sheet

Follow these steps to sync Object data to a Google Sheet:

1. Log in to [Wyzebulb](https://www.wyzebulb.com/) and create a Flow.

1. For the trigger, select the *Webhooks* app.

    ![Select Webhooks.](./using-wyzebulb-to-sync-object-data-with-google-sheets/images/02.png)

1. Select the *Catch Hook* trigger and click *Save + Continue*

1. Click *Webhooks URL* and copy the generated URL.

    ![Copy the Webhook URL.](./using-wyzebulb-to-sync-object-data-with-google-sheets/images/06.png)

1. In your Liferay instance, use the copied URL to [define an Object action](../../creating-and-managing-objects/actions/defining-object-actions.md) that sends a request to the webhook endpoint whenever a new Object entry is added.

1. Add a test Object entry to trigger the webhook.

   This allows the Webhooks module to determine the Object's data structure automatically.

1. Verify the test was successful and click *Save + Continue*.
