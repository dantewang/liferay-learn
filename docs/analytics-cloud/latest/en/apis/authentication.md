# Authentication

An access token is necessary for making API calls to Liferay Analytics Cloud. Navigate to _Settings_ &rarr; _APIs_ to generate an access token.

Choose the duration (e.g. 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, or indefinite) for when the access token will expire. Click _Generate Token_.

The generated token is valid for the duration you selected. Once the token expires, a new token must be generated to perform additional API calls.

To use the new token, click the copy icon (![Copy](../images/icon-copy.png)) to copy the access token to your clipboard. Add this to your request authorization header on every API call. If youâ€™re using curl command line, this can be done by setting the following request header.

```
curl -i -L -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

To delete the access token, click _Revoke_ and the token will be removed.
