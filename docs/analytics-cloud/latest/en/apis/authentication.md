# Authentication

In order for developers to call any of the API endpoints provided, they need to first create a personal access token by accessing their Liferay Analytics Cloud workspace.

The generated token is usable for a default period of 30 days. Once the token expires, a new token must be generated to perform additional API calls.

The token must be copied and set to the request authorization header on every API call. If youâ€™re using curl command line, this can be done by setting the following request header.

```
curl -i -L -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```
