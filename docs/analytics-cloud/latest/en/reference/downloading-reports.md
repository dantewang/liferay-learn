# Downloading Reports

In addition to [inviting team members](../workspace-settings/managing-users.md#inviting-users) to your Analytics Cloud workspace, you can share insights with your team by downloading reports.

Downloadable PDF reports are available for these dashboards:

* [Assets Dashboard for Blogs](../touchpoints/assets/blogs.md)
* [Assets Dashboard for Documents and Media](../touchpoints/assets/documents-and-media.md)
* [Assets Dashboard for Forms](../touchpoints/assets/forms.md)

* [Sites Dashboard](../touchpoints/sites-dashboard.md)

Each PDF report shows the same information as its respective dashboard (e.g. sites dashboard, individuals dashboard, site page dashboard, etc.)
