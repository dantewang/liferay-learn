# Paths

Path Analytics identify where visitors to your site most commonly originate. Knowing how your users are coming to your site's pages can empower you to better tailor your site's content to meeting your users' needs.

## Viewing Page Path Analytics

A Page’s Path Analytics are reported in the Path tab of a Page’s screen. The diagram reports the most common traffic sources for the page. The top three sources appear followed by all other sources that are aggregated with the label Others.

The number value shown over each path indicates the total number of views that came from that traffic source. The different paths converge to a total number shown on the right side of the chart. 

If a Page in one of your Liferay DXP sites is also a Path to the current Page, clicking the path URL brings you to its Overview screen. If it’s not a page that’s loaded from the data source, nothing happens.

Note, the number displayed in the green box shows the number of views that came from direct traffic. 

## Location and Device Type

Path Analytics can be filtered by Location and Device Type. Knowing the Location and Device Type visitors most commonly use to access your site’s Pages helps you determine whether your site and its content are optimized properly.

By default, all views of the Page in the selected time period are represented in the Paths diagram. Filter the Paths being viewed by Location and Device Type. Click the Filter menu and select one Location whose Path diagram you want to see. The Path diagram is updated to represent the top Paths for only the selected Location. The same filtering can be used for Device Type, and the Device Type and Location filters can be combined. For example, view the Path diagram for views coming from smartphones in Germany.

As you select filters, they’re made visible at the top center of the Path screen.

To remove a filter, click the x next to the filter name.
