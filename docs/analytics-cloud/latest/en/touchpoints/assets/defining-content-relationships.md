# Defining Content Relationships

When creating new content, it is possible to use the Related Assets option to define relationships between assets even if they don't share any tags and aren't in the same category. It is a really interesting tool to make related content easily available and organized to be displayed.

Before create a relationship, we need to create a web content first:

1. Go to *Product Menu*(![Product Menu icon.](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and navigate to *Web Content*.

1. Click the *New* icon(![Add icon.](../../images/icon-add.png)), then *Basic Web Content*.

1. Give your new web content a name and a short description.

Once we have a new web content, it is possible to make relationships with it.  

 1. Go to *Product Menu* (![Product Menu icon.](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and navigate to *Blogs*.

 1. Click *Add Blog Entry* (![Add icon.](../../images/icon-add.png)).

 1. Give your new blog entry a title and fill the *Content* field.

1. Now let's define the relationship with the web content created before. Click *Related Assets*.

1. Click *Select*. From here it is possible to choose from any asset category that Lifeary provides.

1. Click *Basic Web Content*. Now you can see the web content created before.

1. Check the checkbox next the web content, then click *Done*.

1. The relationship is now established! Click *Publish* to finish the entry creation.

## Using the Related Assets Widget

Once relationships are created, it is possible to display them with the Related Assets Widget. By default, the Related Assets widget displays any related asset of the asset selected in the Asset Publisher. If you don’t want to show every related asset, you can configure what content relationships to display. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the page editor, then click *Widgets* and search for the Asset Publisher widget on *Fragments and Widgets*. After adding it to the page, configure it so it displays the blog entry created previously. If you need more information, see [Using the Asset Publisher Widget](../../../../../dxp/latest/en/site-building/displaying-content/using-the-asset-publisher-widget.md)

1. Add the Related Assets widget to the page, next to the Asset Publisher widget.

1. Select the *Options* icon(![Options icon](../../images/icon-actions.png)) in the upper right corner of the Related Assets widget and click *Configuration*.

1. Under the *Asset Selection* tab, set the type of asset(s) to display using the *Asset Type* menu. The default value is set to *Any*.

1. You can narrow the scope of the app to display any single category of asset type or select multiple assets from the menu.

Filter options set minimum requirements for displaying assets by their categories, tags, and custom fields. Ordering and Grouping organizes assets using the same criteria. Display settings customize how the widget shows assets: by title, in a table, by abstract, or full content. You can convert assets to different document types like ODT, PDF, and RTF. You can choose to show metadata fields such as author, modification date, tags, and view count. You can even enable RSS subscriptions and customize their display settings.

1. When you’re finished setting the Source and Filter options, click *Save*.

1. Click *Publish*. The Related assets to the entry are displayed when you click it.
