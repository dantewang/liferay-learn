# Definitions for Individuals

The data model for individuals is defined by the various attributes that get mapped when contact data is [synced from DXP](../../getting-started/syncing-sites-and-contacts.md).

To view a list of these attributes, navigate to *Settings* &rarr; *Workspace Data* &rarr; *Definitions* &rarr; *Individuals*.

![A list of attributes is displayed for individuals.](./definitions-for-individuals/images/01.png)

All the different attributes for individuals are listed. Some attributes may be defined by more than one data source. 

You can choose specific attributes for [creating segments](../../people/segments/creating-segments.md) or [creating a specific breakdown for individuals](../../people/individuals/individuals-dashboard.md#breakdown).
