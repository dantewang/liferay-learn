The Commerce dashboard displays metrics for synced Commerce channels. This includes the total value of placed orders, total value of incomplete orders, average order value, and average revenue per account. To track and view this data, you must first sync Commerce channels with Analytics Cloud. See [Connecting Liferay DXP to Analytics Cloud](./getting-started/connecting-liferay-dxp-to-analytics-cloud.md) for more information.
