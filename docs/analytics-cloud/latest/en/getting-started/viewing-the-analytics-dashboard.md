# Viewing the Analytics Dashboard

Once your [Liferay site and contacts are synced](syncing-sites-and-contacts.md), Analytics Cloud automatically begins tracking visitors to your site and how they're interacting with your site's content. The next steps are to explore the different tools available through the navigation menu on the left.

![Explore the different tools through the left navigation.](viewing-the-analytics-dashboard/images/01.png)

For understanding your site's data:

* [Sites Dashboard](../touchpoints/sites-dashboard.md)
* [Individual Pages](../touchpoints/pages/pages.md) and [Paths](../touchpoints/pages/paths.md)
* [Assets](../touchpoints/assets.md)
* [Events Analysis](../touchpoints/events/events-analysis.md)

For understanding your audience:

* [Individuals Dashboard](../people/individuals/individuals-dashboard.md)
* [Individual Profiles](../people/individuals/individual-profiles.md)
* [Segments](../people/segments/segments.md)

```{note}
To explore analytics data based on segments, you must first [Create Segments](../people/segments/creating-segments.md). These are groups of individuals that are aggregated together based on attributes you select.
```

For optimizing site content:

* [A/B Testing](../optimization/a-b-testing.md)

## Inviting Others to Your Workspace

As a workspace owner or admin, you can invite your colleagues to the workspace. Invited users can be configured to help setup and configure data sources, create segments, or simply view analytics reports.

See [Managing Users](../../workspace-settings/managing-users.md) to learn more about adding users to your workspace.

## Configure Settings for Your Workspace

Most of the important settings are configured when you created the workspace. However there are other settings worth reviewing for your workspace.

* Data Definitions
* Data Control and Privacy
* APIs
* Workspace Usage Monitoring
* Workspace Settings

You will begin to see analytics data once your workspace is connected. For example, view Site specific analytics on the [Sites dashboard](../../touchpoints/sites-dashboard.md). To see more about your workspace settings, see [Managing Workspaces](../../workspace-settings/managing-workspaces.md). 

## Language Menu Option

The UI for Analytics Cloud currently supports English, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. To change your language settings, 

1. Click on your user name at the bottom of the dashboard. Then click *Language*.
