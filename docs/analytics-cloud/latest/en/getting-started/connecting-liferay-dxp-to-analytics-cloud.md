# Connecting Liferay DXP to Analytics Cloud

To begin the setup process, there are a few requirements:

1. You need a [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com) account. If you don't have a Liferay account, you can go here to [Create an account](https://login.liferay.com/signin/register).

1. When you visit [analytics.liferay.com](https://analytics.liferay.com/) for the first time, you are prompted to set up multi-factor authentication for the account. If you need help, see [Multi-Factor Authentication](./multi-factor-authentication.md).

1. Your Liferay DXP installation must meet one of the following minimum versions:

    * 7.4 (Any version)
    * 7.3 Fix Pack 1
    * 7.2 Fix Pack 11
    * 7.1 Fix Pack 22
    * 7.0 Fix Pack 98

1. You must have access to at least one Analytics Cloud workspace. Note, as a paid Analytics Cloud user, you should see your workspace upon login. Contact support through [help.liferay.com](https://help.liferay.com/) or email us at <analytics-cloud@liferay.com> for any troubleshooting.

## Connection Token

Next, get your Analytics Cloud token and use it to connect your Liferay instance. Liferay Analytics Cloud and Liferay DXP form a token based connection. A custom token is generated by Analytics Cloud and must be copied and pasted into your Liferay DXP configuration.

1. Log into Analytics Cloud. Select your workspace. If it's your first time logging in, you see an onboarding guide. Click _Next_ and you're shown the Analytics Cloud token in the next screen. Click the Copy icon (![copy icon](../images/icon-copy.png)) to copy the token to your clipboard.

   If you canceled out of the onboarding guide, navigate to _Settings_ &rarr; _Data Sources_. Click _Add Data Source_. Select _Liferay DXP_ and the Analytics Cloud token appears. Click the Copy icon (![copy icon](../images/icon-copy.png)) to copy the token to your clipboard.

1. Log into your Liferay DXP instance. Open the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)). Navigate to _Configuration_ &rarr; _Instance Settings_. Under _Platform_, click _Analytics Cloud_. Paste the Analytics Cloud token in the field and click _Connect_.

    ```{note}
    For Liferay DXP 7.0, Analytics Cloud Admin is found under *Configuration* &rarr; *Analytics Cloud*.
    ```

1. Upon successful connection, the following message appears at the bottom left of your screen:

    `Success: Your request completed successfully`

Congratulations, your Liferay instance is now connected to Analytics Cloud!

The next step is syncing your Liferay site and your contacts. See [Syncing Sites and Contacts](./syncing-sites-and-contacts.md) and follow the steps.
