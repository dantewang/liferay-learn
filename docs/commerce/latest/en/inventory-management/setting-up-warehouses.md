# Setting Up Warehouses

Warehouses represent physical locations where you store product inventory. To activate a warehouse, you must set its geolocation. The Fedex shipping method uses this geolocation to calculate shipping costs. Read [Using the Fedex Shipping Method](../store-management/configuring-shipping-methods/using-the-fedex-shipping-method.md) for more information. 

You can use a single warehouse to serve multiple channels or serve a single channel with multiple warehouses. When using the *Minium* or *Speedwell* accelerators, three sample warehouses serve one channel.

```{note}
Before creating a warehouse, you must enable the applicable country and region of the warehouse. See [Adding Regions](../store-management/configuring-countries-and-regions.md#adding-regions) for more information.
```

## Adding a Warehouse

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Commerce* &rarr; *Warehouses*.

1. Click *Add* (![Add Button](../images/icon-add.png)).

   ![Click the Add button to create a new warehouse.](./setting-up-warehouses/images/01.png)

1. Enter a name.

1. Click *Submit*.

   This creates a new inactive warehouse and opens its details tab.

   ![Enter details for the new warehouse and activate it.](./setting-up-warehouses/images/02.png)

1. (Optional) Edit or localize the name and description.

1. Enter the latitude and longitude values for the warehouse in the Geolocation section.

   Alternatively, you can configure the [Bing Geocoder](#using-bing-geocoder-to-set-a-warehouses-geolocation) to generate a warehouse's geolocation automatically based on the warehouse's address.

1. Enter an address for the warehouse in the Address section.

1. Switch the toggle to *Active*.

   ```{important}
   You must set the geolocation before you can activate the warehouse.
   ```

1. Link the warehouse to one or more channels. This determines the product inventory for those channels.

   Click the *Eligibility* tab, select *Specific Channels*, enter a channel name and click *Select*.

   ![Associate the warehouse to all available channels or specific channels.](./setting-up-warehouses/images/03.png)

1. Click *Save*.

## Using Bing Geocoder to Set a Warehouse's Geolocation

Liferay integrates with the Bing Maps API to generate geolocations from a warehouse address automatically. To use this feature, you must have a [Bing Maps account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/creating-a-bing-maps-account) and a [Bing Maps Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key).

Then, follow these steps to configure the Bing Geocoder for your instance:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), and navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Shipping* &rarr; *Bing Geocoder*.

1. Enter your *API Key*.

   ![Enter your API key for the Bing Maps API.](./setting-up-warehouses/images/04.png)

1. Click *Save*.

Once the geocoder is configured, you can generate warehouse geolocations for any warehouse with an address. Navigate to the warehouses page, click the *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../images/icon-actions.png)) for the desired warehouse, and select *Geolocate*. The geocoder converts the address into latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Liferay 7.4 U46/GA46 and Below

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), and navigate to *Commerce* &rarr; *Warehouses*.

   ![Enter details for the new warehouse and activate it.](./setting-up-warehouses/images/07.png)

1. To activate the warehouse, switch the toggle to *Active*. Ensure that you enter its geolocation before activation.

1. In the Channels section, use the checkbox to associate the warehouse to a channel. The associated warehouses determine the product inventory for a channel.

1. Enter an address for the warehouse in the *Address* section.

1. Enter the latitude and longitude values for the warehouse in the *Geolocation* section.

   Alternatively, see [Using Bing Geocoder to Set a Warehouse's Geolocation](#using-bing-geocoder-to-set-a-warehouses-geolocation) to learn how to automatically generate a warehouse's geolocation.
