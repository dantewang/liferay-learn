# Store Management Permissions

With Liferay Commerce, you can use permissions to control access to Store Management applications and resources in the Commerce tab of the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)).

![Control access to Store Management applications and resources.](./store-management-permissions/images/01.png)

You can manage Store Management permissions for user roles under *Commerce* &rarr; *Store Management* in the Define Permissions tab.  Assign permissions individually, or check *Action* to assign all permissions for an application or resource.

## Application Permissions

Application permissions grant abilities for an application itself, but do not include [related resource permissions](#resource-permissions).

Store Management includes the following applications:

**Channels**: This application is used to create and manage Channels, which are used to display Products and receive Orders.

**Currencies**: This application is used to add and manage the currencies used within a Liferay instance.

All Store Management applications have the following permissions:
