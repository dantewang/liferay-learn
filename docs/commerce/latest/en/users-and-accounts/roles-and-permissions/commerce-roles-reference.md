# Commerce Roles Reference

Liferay includes four [out-of-the-box roles](#out-of-the-box-roles) for Commerce: Account Administrator, Account Member, Buyer, and Order Manager. While these roles are configured to model some common roles, you can create additional account roles or modify the out-of-the-box ones to better suit your use case. Some [common custom roles](#custom-roles) include Catalog Manager, Inventory Manager, Shipment Manager, Instance Order Manager, and Discount Manager.

```{note}
For Liferay 7.3.x and earlier Commerce versions, [Sales Agent](#sales-agent) is also included as an out-of-the-box role.
```

## Viewing Permissions

Follow these steps to view and manage permissions associated with a Commerce role:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), click on the *Control Panel* tab, and go to *Users* &rarr; *Roles*.

   ![Click on Roles in the Control Panel.](./commerce-roles-reference/images/01.png)

1. Click on the desired role:

   * *Account Administrator* (Account Role)
   * *Account Member* (Account Role)
   * Buyer (Account Role)
   * Order Manager (Account Role)

   ```{note}
   In Liferay 7.3 and earlier versions, the Account Administrator is a Site Role, and the Account Member role is not a default role. 
   ```

1. Click on the *Define Permissions* tab.

   From here, you can view a summary of all application and resource permissions assigned to the role.

   You can also remove or add permissions.

## Out-of-the-Box Roles

The following roles are automatically added to your DXP instance during Commerce activation. They are included alongside default DXP roles and can be modified if desired. See [Defining Role Permissions](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.html) for more information.

### Account Administrator

> Account Role

Account Administrators are super users of their account. They can approve or reject orders when there is a [Buyer Order Approval](../../order-management/order-workflows/enabling-or-disabling-order-workflows.md#enabling-workflow) workflow enabled and oversee the Order Managers and Buyers of their Account. They can modify their Account, invite or add users to it, and assign roles to other Account members. Account Administrators cannot create or delete Accounts. This permission is reserved for instance administrators.

The following Account permissions affect the Account Administrator's ability to modify accounts in a B2B setting, while the Open Carts permissions affect the administrator's ability to modify orders regardless of the store type.

## Custom Roles

The following list includes common custom roles you may want to create for your own Commerce instance. These roles can be created in the same way as other DXP roles. See [Creating and Managing Roles](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/creating-and-managing-roles.html) and [Defining Role Permissions](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.html) for more information

### Catalog Manager

> Regular Role

The Catalog Manager role grants permissions to access, create, edit, and manage Products within a specific Catalog. This role is useful in multiple Catalog scenarios, where different vendors or company teams manage different Products in separate Catalogs. Catalog Managers cannot manage inventory. For this responsibility, see [Inventory Manager](#inventory-manager)

| Permissions                                         | Description                                                   |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Catalogs: Access in Control Panel                   | Ability to access the Catalogs application in the Global Menu |
| Catalogs: View                                      | Ability to view the Catalogs application                      |
| Currencies > Commerce Currencies: Manage Currencies | Ability to manage currencies                                  |
| Portal: View Control Panel Menu                     | Ability to access the Global Menu                             |
| Products: Access in Control Panel                   | Ability to access the Products application in the Global Menu |
| Products: View                                      | Ability to view the Products application                      |

In addition to the above permissions, you must also assign *View* and *Update* permissions for the individual Catalogs you want the role will manage.

To do this, open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), click on the *Commerce* tab, and go to *Product Management* &rarr; *Catalog*. Then, click on the *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the desired Catalog, and select *Permissions*. Use the check boxes to assign the role *View* and *Update* permissions.

```{note}
If you'd like your Catalog Manager to manage Products within a Catalog without the ability to modify the Catalog itself, remove the `Catalogs: Access in Control Panel` and `Catalogs: View` permissions.
```

### Inventory Manager

### Shipments Manager

The Shipment Manager role allows a user to process shipments. This includes the ability to add shipping details, shipping dates, add items to the shipment and update shipment status. In Commerce 3.0+ and Liferay 7.3+, users create shipments via the Orders application. If you only want the Shipment Manager to fill and process the shipment, then the following permissions are sufficient. Otherwise, you may want to add additional [Order Manager](#order-manager-regular-role) permissions.
