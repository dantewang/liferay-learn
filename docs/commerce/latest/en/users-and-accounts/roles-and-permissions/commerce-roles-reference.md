# Commerce Roles Reference

Liferay includes four roles [out-of-the-box](#out-of-the-box-roles) for Commerce: account administrator, account member, buyer, and order manager. You can modify these roles or create additional account roles to better suit your use case. Some [common custom roles](#custom-roles) include catalog manager, inventory manager, shipment manager, instance order manager, and discount manager.

```{note}
The sales agent role is available out-of-the-box for Liferay 7.3.x and earlier Commerce versions. It is available in Liferay DXP 7.4 and above through the Minium and Speedwell accelerators only. 
```

## Viewing Permissions

Follow these steps to view and manage permissions associated with a Commerce role:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *Roles*.

   ![Click on Roles in the Control Panel.](./commerce-roles-reference/images/01.png)

1. Click the Account Roles tab and select a role:

   * Account Administrator
   * Account Member
   * Buyer
   * Order Manager

   ```{note}
   In Liferay 7.3 and earlier versions, the account administrator is a site role, and the account member role is not a default role. 
   ```

1. Click the *Define Permissions* tab.

   From here, you can view a summary of all application and resource permissions assigned to the role.

   You can also remove or add permissions.

## Out-of-the-Box Roles

The following roles are available out-of-the-box with your DXP instance. They are included with default DXP roles, and you can modify them if needed. See [Defining Role Permissions](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.html) for more information.

### Account Administrator

> Account Role

Account administrators are account super users. They can approve or reject orders when there is a [buyer order approval](../../order-management/order-workflows/enabling-or-disabling-order-workflows.md#enabling-workflow) workflow enabled and oversee the order managers and buyers of their account. They can modify their account, invite or add users to it, and assign roles to other account members. Account administrators cannot create or delete accounts. This permission is reserved for instance administrators.

The accounts permissions define how account administrators can modify accounts in a B2B setting, while the open carts permissions define how administrators can modify orders regardless of the store type.

### Account Member

> Account Role (included in Liferay 7.4+)

This role is automatically assigned to all users of an account and grants basic view permissions.

| Permission                     | Description                |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Accounts > Account Entry: View | Ability to view an Account |

### Account Supplier

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 7.4 U84+/GA84+`

> Account Role

This is a new account role introduced in Liferay to associate with supplier accounts. The role doesn't have any permissions associated with it, but upon assignment, a user is assigned the regular role of supplier. This role scopes the access of the regular role to the correct channels and catalogs associated with the supplier account. If you directly use the regular role, it grants the supplier access to all catalogs and channels. See [Supplier](#supplier) role below. 

### Buyer

> Account Role

Buyers can make purchases on behalf of the account they are handling. When there's a buyer order approval workflow, they must submit the order to the order manager who decides whether to approve it or not. A buyer can also view and check out orders from another buyer of the same account.

The accounts permissions define the buyer's ability to view and manage addresses, while the open carts permissions define the buyerâ€™s ability to view, create, and check out orders, and also manage other order attributes.

| Permissions                                                          | Description                                         |

### Order Manager

> Account Role

You can use this role to oversee all the purchases made in the account. If there's a buyer order approval workflow, the order manager gets a request from the buyer to approve a purchase. This role grants users all the permissions of buyers and allows them to also manage, delete, and approve orders in a specific site.

| Permissions                                                          | Description                                                                                                |

## Custom Roles

The following list includes common custom roles you may want to create for your own Commerce instance. These roles can be created in the same way as other DXP roles. See [Creating and Managing Roles](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/creating-and-managing-roles.html) and [Defining Role Permissions](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.html) for more information

### Catalog Manager

> Regular Role

The catalog manager role grants permissions to access, create, edit, and manage products within a specific catalog. This role is useful in multiple catalog scenarios, where different vendors or company teams manage different products in separate catalogs. Catalog managers cannot manage inventory. For this responsibility, see [Inventory Manager](#inventory-manager)

| Permissions                                         | Description                                                   |

| Catalogs: Access in Control Panel                   | Ability to access the catalogs application in the Global Menu |
| Catalogs: View                                      | Ability to view the catalogs application                      |
| Currencies > Commerce Currencies: Manage Currencies | Ability to manage currencies                                  |
| Portal: View Control Panel Menu                     | Ability to access the Global Menu                             |
| Products: Access in Control Panel                   | Ability to access the products application in the Global Menu |
| Products: View                                      | Ability to view the products application                      |

In addition to the above permissions, you must also assign View and Update permissions for the individual catalogs you want the role to manage.

To do this, open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), click on the *Commerce* tab, and go to *Product Management* &rarr; *Catalog*. Then, click on the *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the desired Catalog, and select *Permissions*. Use the check boxes to assign the role *View* and *Update* permissions.

```{note}
If you want your catalog manager to manage products in a catalog but not modify the catalog itself, remove the `Catalogs: Access in Control Panel` and `Catalogs: View` permissions.
```
