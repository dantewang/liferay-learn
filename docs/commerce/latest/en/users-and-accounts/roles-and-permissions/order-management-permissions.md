# Order Management Permissions

With Liferay Commerce, you can use permissions to control access to Order Management applications and resources in the Commerce tab of the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)).

![Control access to Order Management applications and resources.](./order-management-permissions/images/01.png)

You can manage Order Management permissions for user roles under *Commerce* &rarr; *Order Management* in the Define Permissions tab. Assign permissions individually, or check *Action* to assign all permissions for an application or resource.

## Application Permissions

Application permissions grant abilities for an application itself, but do not include [related resource permissions](#resource-permissions).

Order Management includes the following applications:

**Orders**: This application is used to view and manage orders across a Liferay instance.

**Shipments**: This application is used for viewing and managing Shipments generated for Orders across a Liferay instance.

**Subscriptions**: This application is used for viewing and managing both active and inactive customer Subscriptions across a Liferay instance.

All Order Management applications have the following permissions:

| Permission | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Access in Control Panel | Ability to access the application in the Global Menu |
| Configuration | Ability to view and set the application's configuration options |
| Permissions | Ability to view and modify the application's permissions |
| Preferences | Ability to view and set application preferences |
| View | Ability to view the application |

## Resource Permissions

Resource permissions grant specific abilities related to application resources. Some of these permissions grant the ability to perform operations on database entities (i.e., model resources). Others grant the ability to perform resource-related operations in an application context (e.g., the ability to create a new resource entity).

Order Management applications reference the following resources:

**Commerce Order** (listed under Orders): These permissions grant the ability to perform operations for Order entities.Orders are created when customers purchase Products in a Channel and are used to store and process order information. Each Order entity includes customer information (i.e., account, billing, shipping), as well as purchased items, order total, date, notes, acceptance workflow status, and more.
