The [Liferay Connector to MuleSoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.liferay/com.liferay.mule/minor/1.1/) connects Liferay DXP to other platforms and services in the MuleSoft ecosystem. You can access the connector via Anypoint Studio or Anypoint Design Center. Learn the basics of the connector's design, as well as how to configure it and set up for a basic flow.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you should be familiar with Mule and Anypoint Studio concepts, such as Mule flows and global elements. To learn more, see [MuleSoft's official documentation](https://docs.mulesoft.com/general/) and consider completing an [Anypoint Studio tutorial](https://developer.mulesoft.com/tutorials-and-howtos).

For connector prerequisites, see Liferay's [Release Notes](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-etl-mulesoft/blob/master/docs/release-notes.adoc).
