# Configuring Shipping Methods

Liferay supports several shipping methods and carriers. Before choosing any shipping method, verify the [Measurement Units](./configuring-shipping-methods/measurement-units.md) that the store uses.

Here are several shipping methods:

* [Variable Rate](./configuring-shipping-methods/using-the-variable-rate-shipping-method.md)
* [Flat Rate](./configuring-shipping-methods/using-the-flat-rate-shipping-method.md)

<!-- Commenting until developer guide is added back
For users interested in adding other shipping methods or carriers, see [Implementing a New Shipping Engine](../developer-guide/sales/implementing-a-new-shipping-engine.md). -->

Shipping methods may be restricted by country or region. To learn more, see [Applying Shipping Method Restrictions](./configuring-shipping-methods/applying-shipping-method-restrictions.md).
