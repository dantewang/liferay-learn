# Notification Template Variables Reference Guide

When creating notification templates, you can use variables to populate email fields dynamically with data from the triggering channel event. Select a notification template *Type* to view its variables. This determines which channel events trigger the notification.

After selecting a type, you can view its variables and their descriptions by expanding *Definition of Terms* in the *Email Settings* and *Email Content* sections. Examples include the customer's name, order ID, shipping and billing addresses, list of order items, and more.
