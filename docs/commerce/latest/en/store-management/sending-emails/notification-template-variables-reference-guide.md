# Notification Template Variables Reference Guide

When creating notification templates, you can use variables to dynamically populate email fields with data from the triggering channel event. To view available variables, first select a notification template *Type*. This determines which channel events trigger the notification.

After selecting a type, you can view available variables and their descriptions by expanding *Definition of Terms* in the *Email Settings* and *Email Content* sections. Examples include the customer's name, order ID, shipping and billing addresses, list of order items, and more.
