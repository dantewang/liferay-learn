# Using Notification Templates

Email notifications are automatically sent to users based on events in the store. To send them, you must first create a *Notification Template*. Notification templates define the sender, trigger, and content of an email notification.

```{note}
To use Liferay Commerce's Notifications feature, first configure mail settings for your Liferay system. See [Configuring Mail](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/setting-up-liferay/configuring-mail.html) for more information.
```

## Event Triggers

Every notification template has a type that determines the channel event that triggers the notification. Commerce includes the following event triggers for notification templates.

| Notification Type       | Event                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Order Placed            | An order is placed in the channel.                                  |
| Order Processing        | The order is in process.                                            |
| Order Awaiting Shipment | The order is ready for shipping.                                    |
| Order Partially Shipped | Order items are shipped separately.                                 |
| Order Shipped           | The order has shipped.                                              |
| Order Completed         | The order has been delivered and marked as complete.                |
| Subscription Renewed    | A subscription is renewed.                                          |
| Subscription Activated  | A subscription is activated.                                        |
| Subscription Suspended  | A subscription is suspended, pending review or action by the store. |
| Subscription Canceled   | A subscription is cancelled.                                        |

   ![Creating and configuring a notification template.](./using-notification-templates/images/07.png)

1. Click *Save*.

The notification template now initiates an automated email upon receiving an order. After creating the template, a new notification is added to the notification queue whenever an order is placed. To view this, you can check the *Notifications Queue* sub-tab after placing an order. By default, the Liferay instance checks the queue every 15 minutes to send any unsent notifications. To learn how to change the interval, see [Configuring the Commerce Notification Queue](./configuring-the-commerce-notification-queue.md).
