# Stripe

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q2+/Portal 7.4 GA120+`

Liferay provides a client extension that integrates with [Stripe](https://stripe.com). It uses the payment integration client extension as a base. See [Configuring Payment Methods](../configuring-payment-methods.md) to read more about the payment methods available out-of-the-box with Liferay.

!!! note
    Currently, the Stripe client extension is only compatible with Liferay SaaS.

1. Click *Get App*, select your account or create one, and accept the end user license agreement and terms of service.

1. Click *Continue*.

1. Select a project from the ones available to you.

1. Click *Get App*.

1. Note the order ID. You must use it to install the app from your Cloud dashboard.

1. Click *Go to Console*.
