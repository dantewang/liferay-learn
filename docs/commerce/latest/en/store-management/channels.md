# Channels

Channels represent a place where you sell products: a Liferay customer portal, a B2B marketplace, or even back office phone sales. By connecting sales channels to Liferay, sellers can manage product content, inventory, orders, and fulfillment across multiple channels in a single place.

To display products and receive orders, a Liferay instance must have at least one channel.

With multiple channels, you can create more than one Liferay site, each with a unique customer experience. You can also connect them to third party software or systems, or use a combination of both. You can configure products and discounts to be available in all channels or specific channels. Similarly, multiple configurations are available at the channel level, including

* Category Display Pages

* Order Workflows
* Order Fields
* Payment Methods
* Product Display Pages
* Shipping Methods
* Taxes
* Countries
* Warehouses
