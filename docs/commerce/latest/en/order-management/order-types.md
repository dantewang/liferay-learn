# Order Types

Orders can be of various types that require different pricing or visibility. For example, a buyer can have stock orders that consist of their restocking purchases. They can also have urgent orders that incur a surcharge but fulfill immediate requirements. By selecting an Order Type, you can view the right prices for products, the eligible shipping and payment methods, and terms and conditions.
