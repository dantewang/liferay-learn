## Payment Terms

Payment Terms govern the terms of a transaction between a buyer and seller. You can specify different Payment Terms for different customers. Liferay provides an editable text field for defining the conditions below, as well as ones you create. 

* The number of days the buyer has to clear their dues.
* Late fees, if any, for failing to pay on the due date.
* Discounts, if any, for settlements made ahead of the due date.
* Any other conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.

```{note}
Payment Terms may also be referred to as Negotiable Instruments and Invoice Payment Terms.
