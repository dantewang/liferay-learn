# Order Rules

You can use order rules to enforce conditions that the buyer must fulfil to continue checking out an order. To enable order rules,

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu icon](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *System Settings*.

1. Go to *Commerce* &rarr; *Orders* and choose *Order Rules* from the left menu.

1. Check the *Enabled* checkbox.

1. Click *Update*.

Now, you can configure order rules by opening the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu icon](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigating to *Commerce* &rarr; *Order Rules*. There are two order rules available out-of-the-box.
