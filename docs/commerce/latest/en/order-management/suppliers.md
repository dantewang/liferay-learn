# Suppliers

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 7.4 U84+/GA84+`

Using Liferay's out-of-the-box supplier account type, you can cater to suppliers and their specific needs. Additionally, you can use the out-of-the-box supplier role to allow them to manage their own catalogs and channels. This greatly reduces the effort to set up suppliers and support multiple vendors in your sites.

!!! important
    Supplier account and role were released behind a [release feature flag](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags#release-feature-flags) in Liferay DXP 7.4 U84/GA84. It was made Generally Available (GA) in 2024.Q1/GA112.
