# Suppliers

{bdg-secondary}`Available Liferay DXP 7.4 U84+/GA84+`

Using Liferay's out-of-the-box supplier account type, you can cater to suppliers and their specific needs. Additionally, you can use the out-of-the-box supplier role to allow them to manage their own catalogs and channels. This greatly reduces the effort to set up suppliers and support multiple vendors in your sites.
