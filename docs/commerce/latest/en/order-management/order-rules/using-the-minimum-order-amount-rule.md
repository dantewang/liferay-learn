# Using the Minimum Order Amount Rule

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 7.4 U1+/GA5+`

Because of the cost to fulfill an order, you may want to accept only orders above a certain amount. You can do this through Order Rules by setting a minimum order amount below which customer checkout is prevented.

## Order Rules Overview

When an Order Rule is applied, the buyer must fulfill the rule to continue checking out. In the case of the minimum order amount rule, buyers must have a total or subtotal cart value set in the rule in order to checkout. If not, a warning message displays the minimum order amount needed to proceed.

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) and enter the following information.

This opens a configuration view for the Order Rule. The *Priority* decides which Order Rule takes precedence when there's more than one rule. The lower number takes priority over the higher one. You can activate it using the *Active* toggle and configure it to apply the minimum order amount to the total or subtotal. You can also set the currency here.

## Order Rule Eligibility
