# Supplier Role

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 7.4 U84+/GA84+`

To enable suppliers to manage their own catalogs and channels, you must add at least one user with the Account Supplier role to a supplier account. These users can manage products in the catalog linked to the supplier account. They can also manage orders, price lists, promotions, warehouses, and inventory present in the channel linked to their supplier account. Suppliers cannot create new discounts, but can override discounts present in price lists and promotions. See [Supplier](../../users-and-accounts/roles-and-permissions/commerce-roles-reference.md#supplier) for more information on all the permissions available.

## Assigning Users to the Supplier Account
