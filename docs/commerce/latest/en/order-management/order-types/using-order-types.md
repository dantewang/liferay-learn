# Using Order Types

{bdg-secondary}`Available Liferay DXP 7.4 U4+/GA8+`

To support the example scenario of stock and urgent orders, you can create two Order Types. Stock orders have regular pricing, and urgent orders incur a surcharge.

```{important}
For orders created using the *Add Order* or *Create New Order* buttons, buyers can choose the Order Type. This updates the product page with the correct prices linked to that Order Type, if any.
```

## Creating an Order Type

If only one Order Type exists, it's assigned to a new order automatically. For Products added to the cart directly, the Order Type with the lower Order number takes precedence over the others. You can always change the Order number in the Order Type to set the default to what you want.

![You can change the Order number of an Order Type to set the default to what you want.](./using-order-types/images/04.png)

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and click on *Commerce* &rarr; *Order Types*.
2. Click the *Add* button(![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)), and enter the following information.

   **Name:** Stock

   **Description:** Order Type for all regular orders

3. Click *Save*.

   This creates the new Order Type and opens a configuration page. The Order field determines the sorting order of the Order Type in the drop down menu. Set the value for the Order field to 0 for the Stock Order Type. Create one more Order Type with the following information.

   **Name:** Urgent

   **Description:** Order type for urgent orders that is subject to a 10% surcharge

Set the value for the Order to 1 for this Order Type. You can use the *Active* toggle to enable it. Under the *Eligibility* tab, you can link the Order Type to a specific Channel or all Channels.

## Linking an Order with an Order Type

You can create a custom Price List and link it to the Urgent Order Type. To add a surcharge, create a Price Modifier on the Price List.

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), and click on *Commerce* &rarr; *Price Lists*.
1. Click the *Add* button(![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) to create a new Price List and enter the following information.

    **Name:** Urgent Order Surcharge

    **Catalog:** Minium

    **Currency:** USD

   ![Enter the name, catalog, and default currency and click Submit to create the Price List.](./using-order-types/images/01.png)

    **Name:** 10% Surcharge

    **Target:** Catalog

    **Modifier:** Percentage

   ![Enter the name, target, and modifier, and click Submit to create the Price Modifier.](./using-order-types/images/02.png)

1. Click *Submit*.
1. Click the new Price Modifier and activate it using the *Active* toggle. Set the *Amount* to 10.
