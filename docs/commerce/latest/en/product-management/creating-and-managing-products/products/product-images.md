# Product Images

Product images help to ensure that customers know what they are buying and increase the likelihood of a sale. If you have a product with different SKUs you can can upload images for each product variant.

## Adding a Single Image

To add a single image:

1. Open the _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Products_.

1. Select a product.

1. Go to _Media_ and under Images, click _Add_ (![Add Icon](../../../images/icon-add.png)) to add a product image.

   ![Adding a product image.](./product-images/images/01.png)

1. Drag and drop an image or click _Select File_ to upload an image.

1. Enter a title and click _Publish_.

This adds the new image to the product. Note that under _Options_, the message "_There are no options set as the SKU contributor._" may appear. If this message appears, then the product does not have additional associated SKUs and the image added is the only one associated with the product.

## Adding Multiple Images

You can also associate multiple product images with a single product. Ensure that you have [product options](./using-product-options.md) created and [multiple SKUs](./creating-skus-for-product-variants.md) generated for each option.

After doing so, you can associate different product images to different SKUs.

1. Open the _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Products_.

1. Select a product.

1. Go to _Media_ and under Images, click _Add_ (![Add Icon](../../../images/icon-add.png)) to add a product image.

1. Drag and drop an image or click _Select File_ to upload an image.

1. Select an option value from the option dropdown to associate the image with.

   ![Adding an image for a SKU.](./product-images/images/02.png)

1. Click _Publish_.

This associates the image with the selected product option value. Repeat these steps for all other available SKUs. For instance, you can use multiple images for a product that comes in different quantities. When searching for a product, you can view all the images in the product details widget.
