# Units of Measure (UOM)

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2023.Q4+/Portal 7.4 GA98+`

Businesses can have different ways of maintaining and selling their stock. This is commonly known as ***Units of Measure*** (UOM). Some of the commonly used units of measure are

* meter/centimeter/millimeter
* ton/kilogram/gram
* pallet/case/unit

You can define your own units of measure to manage, price, and sell your inventory by these defined units. You can also use UOM to sell stock in decimal quantities. 

Units of measure link to SKUs. After creating the first unit of measure, all existing inventory and pricing information for the SKU gets mapped to the new unit. 

```{important}
The first unit of measure you create adopts the pricing and inventory information related to the SKU. If you are introducing units of measure to previously traded SKUs, you must define the unit corresponding to the existing SKU first, and then create any additional UOMs.
