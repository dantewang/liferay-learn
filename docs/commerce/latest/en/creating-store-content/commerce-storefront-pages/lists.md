# Lists

The Lists Page provides customers access to the _Wish Lists_ and _Wish List Contents_ widgets.

Using the Wish List widget, authenticated users can view, create, and manage custom Product lists. They can then use the Wish List Contents widget to view and manage Products added to a list, as well as quickly add those Products to the cart.

Note that a default list is automatically created for each user in a Channel. Also, lists are scoped to be **site** specific; if a Liferay Commerce instance has more than one store site, wish lists are not transferred or saved across sites.
