# Promoting Products

There are several ways to promote your products in Liferay. To start off, you can create a [discount](./promoting-products/introduction-to-discounts.md) that offers incentives to customers. You can also create [promotions](./promoting-products/introduction-to-promotions.md) that show the difference between a productâ€™s list price and its promotion price visually. This is helpful to support multiple prices for individuals or groups of customers. [Product groups](./promoting-products/introduction-to-product-groups.md) are static groups of products you can use for targeted discounts or pricing.

Using [replacement products](./promoting-products/replacement-products.md), you can direct customers to buy the replacement of discontinued or end-of-life (EOL) products and curb potential loss. Finally, you can display both content- and user-based [product recommendations](./promoting-products/product-recommendations.md) that use product and order data from your Liferay instance.

Liferay gives you what you need to promote your products in all the ways you need. Read on to learn how to use these features.
