# Using the Promotion Base List

When you create a new Catalog, a new *Promotion Base List* is automatically created. You cannot control the Eligibility for the Promotion Base List or add any Price Modifiers. You can only use it to add specific entries that you want to target with a promotional price.

To use the Promotion Base List, follow the steps below.

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), go to *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalogs*.

   ![Click on Catalogs and create a new catalog for your products.](./using-the-promotion-base-list/images/01.png)

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) and enter the following information.

   **Name:** Test Catalog

   **Default Catalog Language:** English (United States)

   **Currency:** US Dollar

   ![Enter a name, default catalog language and currency for the new catalog.](./using-the-promotion-base-list/images/02.png)

1. Click Submit.

This creates a new Catalog, and also the new Promotion Base List. To view this, open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), click on *Commerce* &rarr; *Promotions*. You should see the new entry as Test Catalog Base Promotion.

## Adding Entries

The Promotion Base List automatically adds all Products in the corresponding Catalog as entries. Follow the instructions below to target a specific SKU in the Catalog.

1. Search for an SKU in the *Entries* section.

1. Click on the entry from the list.

1. You can enter a Promotion Price, expiration date, and configure [bulk or tiered pricing](../using-price-tiers.md#bulk-pricing-vs-tier-pricing) for the SKU.

   ![You can enter a Promotion Price, expiration date, and configure bulk or tiered pricing for the SKU.](./using-the-promotion-base-list/images/03.png)

1. Click *Save*.

You can also use the Override Discount toggle to give the promotion price precedence over any active Discounts. See the comparison between a promotion overriding a 20% discount and without it.

```{note}
Another way to target an SKU with a promo price is by opening the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and going to *Commerce* &rarr; *Products*. Find and select the product and click on the *SKUs* tab. Select the SKU you want to target and set a *Sale Price* for it. Click *Publish*. This sets the price of the SKU in the Base Promotion List.
