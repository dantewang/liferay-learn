# Replacement Products

Products undergo a life cycle after which they reach end-of-life (EOL). Some products are discontinued completely while others can have a replacement, to bring newer and better variants to the buyers. Using *Replacement Products*, you can direct buyers to the replacement and curb potential loss.

```{note}
Replacement Products are available in Liferay DXP 7.4+/Commerce 4.0+.
```

## Feature Overview

### Viewing a discontinued product

All discontinued products have a label that shows current availability along with its status. A *Replacement Product* button displays the Product Details for the replacement. A *Replacements* section directs users to the replacement product.

### Replacing discontinued products while importing Orders

If an order imported from a CSV file or wishlist contains a discontinued product, it is replaced by its replacement. The discontinued product is not replaced if it's still in stock or allows back orders.

The product is available to buy only if back orders are allowed or until stock lasts, after which the Add to Cart button becomes inactive. Users can click on the active Replacement Product button to view the replacement. There is a section for replacements in the Product Details widget that displays the replacement product.

## Replacement Chaining

Replacement Products support chaining. If Product B replaces Product A and Product C replaces Product B, Product C becomes the replacement for Product A, when both A and B are out of stock and back orders are not allowed.
