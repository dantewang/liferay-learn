# Discount API Basics

You can manage discounts from the Applications menu or with REST APIs. Call the [headless-admin-commerce-pricing](http://localhost:8080/o/api?endpoint=http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-pricing/v2.0/openapi.json) services to create and manage discounts.

## Adding a Discount

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-dxp.md
```

Once Liferay is running,

1. Download and unzip [Discount API Basics](./liferay-r6f7.zip).

   ```bash
   curl https://learn.liferay.com/commmerce/latest/en/pricing/developer-guide/liferay-r6f7.zip -O
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip liferay-r6f7.zip
   ```

1. Discounts are scoped to an instance. Use the cURL script to add a new discount. On the command line, navigate to the `curl` folder. Execute the `Discount_POST_ToInstance.sh` script.

   ```bash
   ./Discount_POST_ToInstance.sh
   ```

   The JSON response shows a new discount was added:

   ```bash
   {
      "actions" : {
         "permissions" : {
            "method" : "PATCH",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-pricing/v2.0/discounts/46111"
         },
         "get" : {
            "method" : "GET",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-pricing/v2.0/discounts/46111"
         },
         "update" : {
            "method" : "PATCH",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-pricing/v2.0/discounts/46111"
         },
         "delete" : {
            "method" : "DELETE",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-pricing/v2.0/discounts/46111"
         }
      },
      "active" : false,
      "amountFormatted" : "0.00%",
      "couponCode" : "",
      "customFields" : { },
      "displayDate" : "2023-02-27T12:31:00Z",
      "externalReferenceCode" : "9df9ffc2-be00-680b-2a2c-69f572bbe65c",
      "id" : 46111,
      "level" : "L1",
      "limitationTimes" : 0,
      "limitationTimesPerAccount" : 0,
      "limitationType" : "unlimited",
      "numberOfUse" : 0,
      "rulesConjunction" : false,
      "target" : "Products",
      "title" : "Foo",
      "useCouponCode" : false,
      "usePercentage" : true
   }
   ```

1. To verify the discount addition, open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Commerce* &rarr; *Discounts*. The new discount appears.

   ![Confirm that a new discount was added.](./discount-api-basics/images/01.png)

You can use a coupon code by setting `useCouponCode` to `true` and setting an appropriate value in the `couponCode` field. To restrict the usage of a coupon code, refer the table below.

| Type                                      | Setting                                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                       |
| :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Restrict by number of uses                | Set `limitationType` to `limited for total` and `limitationTimes` to an arbitrary integer, for instance, 5.                                               | You can use the coupon code up to 5 times.                                                        |
| Restrict by number of uses per account    | Set `limitationType` to `limited for account` and `limitationTimesPerAccount` to an arbitrary integer, for instance 5.                                    | Each account can use the coupon code up to 5 times                                                |
| Restrict by number of uses and by account | Set `limitationType` to `limited for account and total`, `limitationTimesPerAccount` and `limitationTimes` to an arbitrary integer, for instance 2 and 5. | Each account can use the coupon code up to 2 times, with the total coupon code usage capped at 5. |

1. Alternatively, call the REST service using the Java client. Navigate into the `java` folder and compile the source files:

   ```bash
   javac -classpath .:* *.java
   ```

1. Run the `Discount_POST_ToInstance` class.

   ```bash
   java -classpath .:* Discount_POST_ToInstance
   ```

## Examine the cURL Command

The `Discount_POST_ToInstance.sh` script calls the REST service with a cURL command.

```{literalinclude} ./discount-api-basics/resources/liferay-r6f7.zip/curl/Discount_POST_ToInstance.sh
    :language: bash
```

Here are the command's arguments:

| Arguments                                                                                                                            | Description                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`                                                                                                | Set the request body format to JSON.                     |
| `-X POST`                                                                                                                            | Set the HTTP method to invoke at the specified endpoint. |
| `"http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-pricing/v2.0/discounts"`                                                           | Specify the REST service endpoint.                       |
| `-d "{\"level\": \"L1\", \"limitationType\": \"unlimited\", \"target\": \"products\", \"title\": \"Foo\", \"usePercentage\": true}"` | Enter the data to post.                                  |
| `-u "test@liferay.com:learn"`                                                                                                        | Enter basic authentication credentials.                  |

```{note}
Basic authentication is used here for demonstration purposes. For production, you should authorize users via [OAuth2](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/headless-delivery/using-oauth2.html). See [Using OAuth2 to Authorize Users](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/headless-delivery/using-oauth2/using-oauth2-to-authorize-users.html) for a sample React application using OAuth2.
```

The other cURL commands use similar JSON arguments.

## Examine the Java Class

The `Discount_POST_ToInstance.java` class adds a discount by calling the `DiscountResource` service.

```{literalinclude} ./discount-api-basics/resources/liferay-r6f7.zip/java/Discount_POST_ToInstance.java
   :dedent: 1
   :language: java
   :lines: 9-27
```

This class invokes the REST service using only three lines of code:

| Line (abbreviated)                                                         | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DiscountResource.Builder builder = ...`                                   | Get a `Builder` for generating a `DiscountResource` service instance.        |
| `DiscountResource discountResource = builder.authentication(...).build();` | Use basic authentication and generate a `DiscountResource` service instance. |
| `discountResource.postDiscount(...);`                                      | Call the `discountResource.postDiscount` method and pass the data to post.   |

Note that the project includes the `com.liferay.headless.commerce.admin.pricing.client.jar` file as a dependency. You can find client JAR dependency information for all REST applications in the API explorer in your installation at `/o/api` (e.g., <http://localhost:8080/o/api>).

```{note}
The `main` method's comment demonstrates running the class.
```

The remaining example Java classes call different `DiscountResource` methods.

```{important}
See [DiscountResource](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/[$LIFERAY_LEARN_PORTAL_GIT_TAG$]/modules/apps/commerce/headless/headless-commerce/headless-commerce-admin-pricing-client/src/main/java/com/liferay/headless/commerce/admin/pricing/client/resource/v2_0/DiscountResource.java) for service details.
```

Below are examples of calling other `Discount` REST services using cURL and Java.

## Get Discounts from Instance

List all the discounts in your Liferay instance with a cURL or Java command.

### Discounts_GET_FromInstance.sh

Command:

```bash
./Discounts_GET_FromInstance.sh
```

Code:

```{literalinclude} ./discount-api-basics/resources/liferay-r6f7.zip/curl/Discounts_GET_FromInstance.sh

   :dedent: 1
   :language: java
   :lines: 9-25
```

## Delete a Discount

Delete an existing discount with cURL and Java `delete` commands. Replace `1234` with your discount's ID.

### Discount_DELETE_ById.sh

Command:

```bash
./Discount_DELETE_ById.sh 1234
```

Code:

```{literalinclude} ./discount-api-basics/resources/liferay-r6f7.zip/curl/Discount_DELETE_ById.sh
